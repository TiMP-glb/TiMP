                <p>Over the past weeks as God has given me context on what to write/discuss. It was also clear that the
                    latest TiMP remain for a couple of weeks to give you all time to read and reflect. Same was the case
                    for the previous week. The Hard to Breathe and Missed Opportunities can be hard reads to absorb no
                    matter your racial or economic identification. However I believe it's important that we have
                    self-evaluation and continued communication of the tough social issues. I understand that God has
                    blessed and provided me a platform. I also grasp the importance of using it to elevate Christ as
                    well as not being afraid to challenge and address issues in the world today. Being fully transparent
                    my position is not political, nor is it black or white, my position is Christ. Therefore because my
                    position is Christ I also understand I must endure and swallow some things, I would otherwise react
                    to differently. As I see and listen to various news articles and talk shows related to world
                    affairs, politics, entertainment the list goes on an on. I began to notice this common thread across
                    the majority being reported and discussed. "God is Not Included".</p>

                <p>It reminded me of that long standing old phrase when you buy a toy or something that needs power to
                    work and the package says "batteries not included". It seems God is the forgotten piece and Twitter,
                    Instagram and Facebook are the gods we trust. From those who claim their conservative foundation to
                    those with so called "liberial and social views", they all mark their beliefs by their own illusions
                    rather than God's inclusion. It's imperative the world recognize that in order for the forces of
                    truth, change and wisdom to operate successfully the dependency on the power of God must be at work.
                    Any achievements without God are only momentary man-made solutions. We often forget man is not a
                    problem solver man is a problem creator. If men or women ever actually solved a problem there would
                    be no need to adapt, amend or rewrite history and assuredly no need for God.</p>

                <p>The real reality for long lasting permenant gain is God's plan and direction, must be at the core and
                    not just a prop. Man must stop using equality as a mechanism to condone sin and thus creating laws
                    and
                    rules contrary to God's standard. The Word must be the ulitimate position of structrual reckoning to
                    promote the past as informative history and set the future as a new day realized. You see, we can
                    all join in with the taking down of monuments, changing the names and images that still stand for
                    slavery, racism, Jim Crow, oppression or any other injustice. The world can march, chant, throw
                    money and meaningless words at all the problems. However, until hearts change and the pen begins to
                    instruct based on God's principles and not that of man. We will continue to fight against a system
                    not capable of doing what is right and that system is all of us.</p>

                <p>The Apostle Paul wrote about this very subject long ago in the book of <span class="bold">Romans
                        1:28-32</span> which shows how
                    pertenant God's word is today. 28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them
                    up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. 29 They were filled with all manner of
                    unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit,
                    maliciousness. 30 They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful,
                    inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though
                    they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only
                    do them but give approval to those who practice them.</p>
