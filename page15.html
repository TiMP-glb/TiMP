                <p>If you are one who loves God, then there is this automatic assumption that there is nothing
                    impossible for God. This notion in part is derived from our internal perception of God being God.
                    It’s also influenced by the Bible and how some have watered down or miss interpreted the scriptures.
                    As we take a look and READ Genesis 18:4, Matthew 19:26, Luke 1:37, as just a few from the many other
                    scriptures. You will hopefully notice that these scriptures have one common thread between them all.
                    They all speak to man and woman’s limited abilities. As human beings on our own, there is only so
                    much we can do or understand. Therefore, our dependency must rely on God the creator to achieve what
                    seems impossible to us. To break the context of scripture down a bit further we often find the word
                    “with” within the text. Now follow me hear, when you look up the definition of “with” you will see
                    multiple ways it can be applied. But as it relates to our dependency it says
                    <span class="bold">accompanied by or on side of.</span> So now imagine Abraham and Sarah in Genesis
                    being <span class="bold">accompanied by Jesus</span>
                    when trying to have a child at their old age. Let’s imagine the disciples in the book of Matthew
                    after their encounter with the rich young ruler that rejected Jesus. Rest assured they were glad to
                    be <span class="bold">on the side of</span> Jesus’s free gift of salvation. Let’s us not forget Mary
                    in the book of Luke being
                    <span class="bold">accompanied by</span> The Almighty in her womb that He created. There He is
                    inside her preparing to becoming flesh to suffer, die and rise up for the sake of everyone of us
                    sinners! </p>

                <p>I tell you today there is no one and I mean no one like Jesus! Yet, fortunately for us not all things
                    are possible for Him. Yes, that’s right God, The I am, The Beginning and The End, The Alpha and the
                    Omega, Jehovah Jireh (meaning the Lord will provide) can’t do everything contrary to popular belief.
                    Now before you all try and burn me at the stake or stop coming to this website. I will list them for
                    you here and if you did not know this hopefully you learned something new this week. Then growing
                    forward, you can hear, read and study the word with a new and refreshed prospective, knowing that
                    God cannot:</p>

                <p><span class="bold">SIN –</span> “And you know that Jesus came to take away our sins, and there is no
                    sin in Him.” (1 John 3:5) NLT</p>

                <p><span class="bold">LIE –</span> “So God has given both His promise and His oath. These two things are
                    unchangeable because it is
                    impossible for God to lie…” (Hebrews 6:18) NLT</p>

                <p><span class="bold">SLEEP –</span> “Indeed He who watches over Israel never slumbers or sleeps” (Psalm
                    121:4) NLT</p>

                <p><span class="bold">BE TEMPTED or TEMPT –</span> “Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being
                    tempted by God,” for God cannot be
                    tempted with evil, and He Himself tempts no one.” (James 1:13) ESV</p>

                <p><span class="bold">CHANGE –</span> “Jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever” (Hebrews 13:8)
                    ESV</p>

                <p><span class="bold">DENY HE IS GOD –</span> “If we are unfaithful, He remains faithful, for He cannot
                    deny who He is.” (2 Timothy
                    2:13) NLT</p>

                <p><span class="bold">FAIL –</span> ”remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no
                    other; I am God, and there is
                    none like Me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done,
                    saying,
                    ‘My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all My purpose.” (Isaiah 46:9-10) KJV</p>

                <p>Is it not amazing that things that are impossible for God cement the true fact that He is God!</p>
