                <p>Well over the past TiMPs as I mentioned God was directing me to leave each for more than a week,
                    before starting this new series. This was to allow you all the opportunity to read, meditate and
                    hopefully take heed of His wisdom and teachings. I constantly try to encourage this as it is vital
                    to our spiritual and personal growth. As noted, we are living in a time where everything seems out
                    of control. But again, I tell you that there is one who is never out of control and that is the Lord
                    God Almighty. I thank Him for His Holy Spirit and presence in that often times we need not be so
                    quick to move on to the next. When we have not even fully taken in what is currently on our plate.
                </p>

                <p>As we begin this new series, I sincerely ask you all in TiMP nation around the world to prayer for
                    me. Pray that God will pour out His spirit upon this teaching and that it will impact someone to
                    desire a deeper relationship with Jesus. Now like any good story or writing there must be a
                    beginning, or what you would call a starting point. Once this is established everything can become
                    clear or obvious to the eye or mind. Thus, allowing the actions or facts to move along in a steady,
                    continuous stream. In other words, manifest and flow. As we read <span class="bold">John
                        1:1-5</span> that is exactly what we
                    see. This particular passage in context of these five verses is the fundamental foundation of
                    everything in the word of God. Now although we recognize <span class="bold">Genesis 1:1</span> as
                    the start of the bible and
                    creation, and the first book of the Law, or Torah or Pentateuch. The fact is John 1:1 is the true
                    starting point and as we journey through this series, we will undoubtedly see the effective change
                    of Jesus.</p>

                <p>When you read both scriptures, they start out exactly the same ‘In the beginning’. However, once you
                    get past that portion you will notice two distinct differences. The text in Genesis establishes the
                    actions of God and the execution of those actions by Jesus. This bears witness to Jesus’s effect on
                    changing nothing into something and how that something manifested and flows even today. However, the
                    text in John establishes the absolute pre-existence of the Word himself (Jesus Christ) and His
                    position as the second person of the Trinity (God The Father, Jesus, Holy Spirit). When we define
                    the word ‘absolute’ we find, not qualified or diminished in any way; total. So, what this means is
                    that there is nothing relative or comparative to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>There is a very popular song amongst Christian radio that’s been around for a few years called So
                    Will I. Now at first glance in listening to the song it’s seems amazing and lots of folks’ love and
                    are touch by it. I’m a bit different as God is always perking up my hears when it comes to His word.
                    So, as I’m listening to the song some time ago. I recognized the first part says; “God of creation,
                    there at the start, before the beginning of time, with no point of reference”. I could hear God
                    clear as day say, “They have that wrong, I AM the point of reference”. God was also showing me that
                    throughout the song, 13 times to be exact they use the conjunctive noun <span
                        class="bold">“if”</span>. Which is a supposition
                    word, meaning it’s a word that conveys uncertain belief. Then God said, “How can they sing about Me
                    and not be certain in what they say”. This is why it pays to be careful what and who we listen to,
                    as everything that sounds good may not be good for you. Now with fresh eyes and ears look at what
                    John is establishing in his writing. In verse 1, he is definitively conveying to us whether you are
                    a believer or non-believer. That in order to have a Genesis starting point regarding all creation we
                    must cling tightly to one fact with certainty, that in the beginning was The Word. </p>
