            <div class="timptext">
                <p>Hola! I pray all has been well with each of you around TiMP nation this week. Our new teaching series
                    will take a look at “The Unchallenging Church”. Our teaching will center around the prophet Isaiah
                    whose name means “The Lord is salvation”. His writings are the most quoted of any Old Testament
                    prophet in the New Testament of the Bible. We will look at <span class="bold">Isaiah 29:9-16</span>
                    where the prophet in
                    context is speaking on mechanical religion and blind disobedience. This is directed at the city of
                    Ariel which means “lion of God”, which is the city of David or in its common name Jerusalem.
                    However, <span class="bold">our emphasis will be on verse 13</span>, where Isaiah notes that the
                    Lord said, “In as much as
                    this people draw near with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but have removed their hearts
                    far from Me, and their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men”.</p>

                <p>Now doesn’t verse 13 seem highly applicable when we look at most of the church landscape around the
                    world today. This assuredly does not include all churches or people who attend church. However,
                    there is a vastness of guilt by association or similarities where it may be hard to tell. I
                    recognize some may be offended by this subject matter. But I’ve found in my experience that most are
                    at the ready to defend their respective church. It’s a natural reaction as none of us want to say or
                    think my church is that unchallenging church. However, if you have to defend your church rather than
                    telling someone to come and experience the presence of God. Then that is truly the issue in itself.
                </p>

                <p>Most of today’s church culture is so far from challenging anyone to reverently worship God. This is
                    because most have confused how we are to present ourselves before the Lord. Reverent and fearful
                    approach in awe of God seemingly has no place in what’s termed today as “seeker sensitive” churches.
                    I was speaking to someone whom I’d just met recently, they told me at their church they have
                    modified some things as not to come off so overly religious to attendees. At most churches
                    technology is all the rage with the latest and greatest sound system and visual effects. Then the
                    rock band style “quote unquote” worship music to get the crowd excited about the message and being
                    in church for 45 minutes to an hour. All this while sitting in the dark during the service to set
                    the mood or shall I say ambiance. God has had me speak on this before but I feel, <span
                        class="bold">1 Peter 2:9</span> says
                    it best, “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession,
                    that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness”. Now contextually this
                    relates to leaving a life of sin (darkness) and coming to light and salvation of Jesus Christ.
                    However, I think you get the point here. Now honestly, I can have it either way during the music. But
                    when the message is being delivered the lights should be on in my humble opinion.</p>

                <p>Then the message is served liked a breakfast sandwich or a light lunch at your favorite friendly
                    neighborhood fast food restaurant. Two hours later, you are hungry but unfortunately most churches
                    don’t serve dinner today from the pulpit or stage. Gone are the days of getting a full meal on the
                    word of God. If your church if serving dinner spiritually today, then you are fortunate indeed. But
                    be aware that which looks like dinner may just be a bunch of whooping and not clearly understood
                    hollering to cover up the breakfast sandwich. In most cases today but not all, the church culture is
                    calculated and designed. It’s setup to appease and stimulate the visual and hearing senses of the
                    attendees as not to offend their feelings. However, the real intent of church and worship is
                    supposed to be about God. More importantly with conviction and unapologetically spreading and
                    teaching the gospel. Both <span class="bold">Matthew 4:4</span> and <span class="bold">Luke
                        4:4</span> clearly account for us what Jesus said when being
                    tempted by Satan said, “It is written, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
                    comes from the mouth of God”. You see the word of God is meant to be the key and fully sustaining
                    source by which we live. </p>

                <p>So here is Jesus saying to Isiah, my people are just doing lip service, they just follow routines
                    that man has establish for them. Not only that, but most when they enter into the house of worship
                    are so far from Me. This is not and easy thing to hear, but the reality is we no longer enter into
                    the presence of God when we gather. We enter into the presence of each other. Jesus is challenging
                    how we enter into His presence, Jesus through the gospel even challenges how we live, how we walk,
                    how we talk. Why are most churches not challenging us with the unadulterated gospel today? Or the
                    better question why do we sit in our chairs or pews week after week and not challenge the church and
                    those that lead? They have a responsibility first to God and then to elevate His standard. We have
                    forgotten to be like David when entering God’s presence, “But as for me, I will come into thy house
                    in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple”. <span class="bold">Psalm 5:7</span></p>
