            <div class="timptext">
                <p>We have all been taught throughout time that the lion is “king” of the jungle. From his large paws
                    ready
                    to swipe at prey. To his carnivorous canine teeth not only ready to strike fear in the heart but to
                    devour anything in his path. Now could you imagine coming face to face, just inches away from such a
                    beast with no place to run! Well that is exactly what Daniel faced. However, that’s the literal part
                    of
                    the story we all recognize and know. Because it’s visual, present and captivating. However, how many
                    of
                    you have ever considered how Daniel got to that point?</p>

                <p>Most if they know the story, would say well he did not follow the king’s orders. That would be
                    partially
                    correct. Though the actual answer Daniel provides himself in the very beginning of his writings.
                    Even
                    before the lion pit and before his friends were put in the fiery furnace. Daniel tells us that “he
                    purposed his heart, that he would not defile himself” <span class="bold">(Daniel 1:8)</span>.
                    In other words Daniel made it his intention and objective not to compromise or be untrue to His
                    commitment to God. Despite being taken into captivity and even having his name changed to
                    (Belteshazzar), Daniel maintained these primary 3 characteristics:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Principles:
                        <a style="font-weight: normal !important;">
                            <br>
                            To partake in any of the earthly king Nebuchadnezzar’s pagan food, drink or activities,
                            would
                            mean
                            dishonor to the real King that is and was to come. Therefore he refrained.
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Faith:
                        <a style="font-weight: normal !important;">
                            <br>
                            The revelations God had given him and his desire to be obedient, would lead to the lion
                            seeking to destory and devour him. Yet he believed and trusted God.</a>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Purpose:
                        <a style="font-weight: normal !important;">
                            <br>
                            That his heart belonged to the real King that is and was to come. To please God was his only
                            mission.
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Daniel had purposed himself in these characteristics which gave him a boldness and thus he was not
                    afraid to take a stand for righteousness.</p>

                <p>In prep for Part 2 take time this week to ask yourself this question:
                    <br>
                    For what or who is your heart purposed?
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold">READ: Daniel chapters 1 & 2</span></p>

                From Greg’s TiMP Garden:
                In studying and preparing for this series a lot has occurred. First, trying to get a new website/blog
                approach launched and the Coronavirus pandemic. The latter which is effecting families in various ways
                from sickness, to job loss, to financial struggles even death. As with any adversity it’s forces you to
                make a choice. Either one of faith or one of fear. We are experiencing a time when the hearts of men and
                women are being tested and revealed. My prayer is that those hearts will turn to God and recognize that
                He is in control that He is King! -->
