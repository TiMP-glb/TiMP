                <p>Happy Sunday All! Last week was part 3 of our series and how awesome a lesson God provided! What a
                    peace of mind and spirit to know that all things were made by Jesus! Now that should truly make you
                    excited! To also know without pause that the wind, sea and nothing else can affect Jesus but He can
                    surely have an effect on everything. Also, if you study <span class="bold">Matthew 8:23-27</span>
                    closely and note the actions
                    of Jesus on the boat. They are in parallel to His death, burial and resurrection. You see when Jesus
                    decides to lay down and fall asleep, that represented His death, Him laying down his life on the
                    cross for you and I. When the boat was covered by the waves, that represented His burial in the
                    tomb. But then, the bible says that the disciples awoke Him and He arose from His sleep, this
                    represents the resurrection. And then lastly in accordance with the word of God from <span
                        class="bold">Matthew
                        28:16-18.</span> We find in context that Jesus appears before the disciples, in where, you
                    guessed it,
                    Galilee. And just like He showed them His authority on the boat that night prior to His crucifixion.
                    And now as the resurrected Savior reiterates to them and says, “All authority has been given to Me
                    in heaven and on earth”. And from this we get the Great Commission from Jesus, to go forth and make
                    disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy spirit.</p>

                <p>I wanted to share this and truly put a cap on Part 3 before moving to Part 4 of “The Effective Change
                    of Jesus”. Therefore, because the next portion of our series deserves it’s on platform, we will
                    pause here. And we will look forward to next week as we dive into verses 4-5 of John chapter 1. In
                    the meantime, please pray for one another and even our enemies, I truly have to remind myself of the
                    latter daily. Also, for this world and those trying to bring about change and the leaders within it.
                    Although we may not agree with every point of view, stance or every person in authority or seeking
                    authority. Our obligation if a saved born-again believer, should be to seek first the kingdom of God
                    and His righteousness <span class="bold">(Matthew 6:33).</span> Seeking His righteous standard adds
                    His full care and
                    provision to your life. We then can project and pour out a righteous spirit towards those things we
                    are praying for including ourselves. This most certainly puts us in the best position to make any
                    measure of difference in this crazy sinful world. Amen.</p>
