                <p>Good day and God’s safety and covering to all of TiMP nation and everyone around the world on this
                    first Sunday in March. We would be hard pressed today not to mention the present situation of war in
                    the Ukraine. This is a sad state of affairs anytime people in power and authority deem conflict and
                    lose of life as a means to an end. Most of us can’t wrap our minds around this type of scenario
                    occurring in this day and time. Although history and biblical history records these types of events
                    have been occurring throughout the existence of the world and will continue. However, we must
                    understand that what you see with your eyes as man being in control or out of control, is just a
                    small portion of the process. We must come to realize that God is, and always will be in control.
                    The things we cannot gasp or fathom are all a part of preparation for the return of His son, Christ
                    Jesus! When we look to <span class="bold">Matthew chapter 24</span>, we see where the disciples are
                    questioning Jesus on His
                    return (this is known as the tribulation/rapture). I encourage you to read the entire chapter, but I
                    want to bring to your attention in particular <span class="bold">verses 6-8</span>. It is a clear
                    reminder that today’s events
                    around the world are maintaining God’s truth. Simply put things are going to get worse and Jesus
                    will return to judge this sinful fallen world. Oh, but Jesus says to the believer “don’t be
                    troubled”. Interesting we will come back to this in just a bit.</p>

                <p>I know our study is in Hebrews, however the afore mentioned ties directly into “the warning” we
                    discussed two Sundays ago. That warning along with current events and future events to come should
                    have you contemplating one distinct question, “Are you ready for the return of Christ Jesus”?</p>

                <p>Granted no one knows the day and time when Jesus shall return, not even the angels, nor Christ
                    himself, only God the Father knows, <span class="bold">Matthew 24:36</span>. However, our
                    preparation through Faith should be
                    the goal. If you are saved then you should fully understand the meaning of that statement. You
                    should also understand it as a call to action in order to reach those who do not. Now for those of
                    you who are not saved, think of it this way, when you are planning to travel you make preparations.
                    Those preparations include all things you find necessary or essential for your well being and safe
                    journey. Well, I’m here to tell you that the preparation I’m speaking of is for eternal life! The
                    good news is, there is only one essential you need in order for your destination to be successful
                    and that my friends is the one and only Christ Jesus!</p>

                <p>Now, I want you to recognize how the warning actually transitions to faith when studying Hebrews.
                    Starting in <span class="bold">Hebrews chapter 3</span> which notes the faithfulness of Christ
                    Jesus. In the latter <span class="bold">verse 9</span> we
                    see how Christ through His faithful obedience and suffering was perfected, and He is the author of
                    eternal salvation to all who obey Him. This takes us back to our “don’t be troubled” statement from
                    Christ Jesus. This is important, because when Christ is speaking this to the disciples it also
                    applies to us believers today, as it speaks to relationship. You read me noting this often, about
                    having a relationship with Christ. Well, that relationship begins in believing, but it’s rooted in
                    faith. <span class="bold">Hebrews 11:1</span> teaches us exactly that, “Now faith is the substance
                    of things hoped for, the
                    evidence of things not seen”. If you notice it’s a parallel statement (similarity) and when studying
                    you will find it has a hint of poetry as some scholars note relative to the Psalms of David.</p>

                <p>However, this should be your confidence in not being troubled. When breaking down this scripture we
                    see 4 significant words, Faith, Substance, Hope, Evidence all occurring without our physical vision.
                    For the purpose of this study, we will save Faith for last. The first word we will look at is
                    <span class="bold"><u>Substance</u></span>. More importantly what is the substance here in this
                    verse, well that is Christ. When
                    looking up the word you find these two applicable characteristics defined,
                </p>

                <p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><i>the real physical matter of which a person or thing consists and which has a tangible, solid
                            presence.</i> The was our Savior as he became a tangible solid presence for man to
                        physically see
                        and touch.</li>
                    <li><i>the quality of being important, valid, or significant.</i> This is our returning Messiah and
                        the
                        importance of establishing a valid relationship with Him as it is significant to one’s eternal
                        life.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>The second is <span class="bold"><u>Hope</u></span>, when looking up the word you find these two
                    applicable characteristics defined,</p>

                <p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><i>a feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing to happen.</i> For those of us in
                        relationship with Christ, we should be longing for His return.</li>
                    <li><i>a feeling of trust.</i> This is the essence of what Faith is all about. It is an unwavering,
                        stand
                        firm position that God is our Father and Christ Jesus alone is our Savior and their will and
                        purpose is what is best.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>The third is <span class="bold"><u>Evidence</u></span>, when looking up the word you find one
                    applicable characteristic defined,</p>

                <p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><i>the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true
                            or valid.</i> This evidence one needs a bit of context as the scripture notes “evidence not
                        seen”.
                        This is a two-fold reality as some of the prophets, disciples and others did see Christ.
                        However, if you recall the author here did not and his belief is based indirect application; the
                        same as we are today. The evidence of God and Christ existence is evident all around us, from
                        the air we breathe to the changing of seasons. It exists in all the evidence of documents even
                        outside the Holy Scriptures, that Jesus was physically on Earth, that he was crucified and
                        resurrected. All these events were witnessed, just not by our generation. Therefore, we must
                        live by just as the Hebrew author did, and here comes that word Faith.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>Our time is up for this week but we will pick up again in two Sunday’s right where we left off as my
                    lovely wife and I will be on vacation March 13th – March 20th. So, in the interim take time to study
                    to show thyself approved unto God…….<span class="bold">2 Timothy 2:15</span>. Please keep us in your prayers, keep the faith
                    and I will see you all back here soon. Love you all and God’s covering.</p>
