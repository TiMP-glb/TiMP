                <p>Hello TiMP Nation hope you are having a blessed Sunday. Let’s jump right into our final piece on
                    Speaking in Tongues. Last week we discussed what happened in Acts, which was a supernatural event
                    needed for that time. The Christian church is being established and therefore the gospel of Jesus
                    Christ being clearly understood by all is vital. There are a few other times speaking in tongues is
                    spoken of in God’s word additionally in <span class="bold">Acts 10:46</span> and <span
                        class="bold">19:6</span> (Paul at Ephesus read for your
                    reference), the other we find in <span class="bold">Isaiah 28:11-12.</span> We will take a look at a
                    couple of these is brief
                    context to see that God makes this topic of tongues simple for us to understand. However, it is
                    man’s evil desire that has confused this for so many. Just like at Corinth the believer’s there were
                    experienced at evil but severely lacking in wisdom and maturity, which Paul speak on in <span
                        class="bold">1
                        Corinthians 14:20.</span></p>

                <p>“Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be babes, but in understanding be
                    mature”. KJV</p>

                <p>Simply put Paul is saying don’t be childish, there is some inexperience as little babies when it
                    comes to evil, but you really need to be mature in your understanding of things like this. If you
                    recall this comes right off the heels of him saying ‘’he would rather speak 5 words that make sense
                    and will be effective, than ten thousand words that mean nothing’’ in verse 19. </p>

                <p>You see the actual intended purpose of the gift of speaking in tongues in human understood language
                    was to effect and or impact the UNBELIEVER! God first gives us a glimpse of what was to come in
                    <span class="bold">Isaiah 28:9-12 (read)</span>, when dealing with the unbelieving Israel. In short,
                    since the drunk and
                    unbelieving would not listen to God’s prophet Isaiah, Israel being under oppression by the Assyrians
                    would get instruction from them in a foreign language. Now the Assyrians spoke Akkadian and
                    Israelites spoke Hebrew, but when you read verse 12, you see where God gives Israel the gift to
                    understand. This was God giving them relief from their oppressors, the bible verse uses the term
                    “This is the refreshing”. So here is God giving a Hebrew speaking Israelite the gift to understand
                    an Akkadian speaking Assyrian, but unfortunately the word says “Yet they would not hear”. Paul
                    refers to this same Old Testament passage of scripture in <span class="bold">1 Corinthians
                        14:21-22</span>, confirming for us
                    in verse 22 this fact:</p>

                <p>”So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but to unbelievers; ………”. NLT</p>

                <p>Paul again in <span class="bold">Acts 10:46</span> lays out the truth about tongues in what most of
                    us know as the popular
                    biblical account of Cornelius the Centurion. Cornelius’s story and what occurred amongst those in
                    his household is regarded as one of the first accounts of Gentiles receiving salvation. Cornelius
                    was a rare Roman soldier a legion leader that had given up pagan worship and believed in God but had
                    not come to the knowledge of Christ. Thus, enter Peter preaching Jesus to Cornelius and his
                    household. <span class="bold">I strongly suggest you read Acts chapter 10 in its entirety</span>, as
                    it all starts with
                    visions that both Cornelius and Peter have which sets them on a course to meet. But our brief focus
                    is on verse 46 where it says “For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God”. In short,
                    this meeting occurs in Caesarea (named after Augustus Caesar) but Peter brings with him some
                    brethren from Joppa this is important to know. One because Caesarea was the bridge city between Rome
                    and Judea, it had political and economic prominence. Therefore, it attracted people from every
                    type of group within the province. Joppa (Jaffa) was a town southwest of Israel and is the port city
                    of Jerusalem. Meaning you had different languages and even dialects coming in contact with each
                    other during this meeting of Peter and his crew as well as Cornelius’s family and friends. Dialect
                    meaning for example people can have the same language but say things differently. In the U.S. south
                    you will hear the word “soda” in the north you will hear “pop” referring to a carbonated beverage. Both instances are known English language. 
                    In my Latin Americas culture, we say “jugo” for juice but in European Spain you will likely here
                    “zumo”. Again both are considered Spanish language. Therefore, if you did not know Peter was bilingual and likely was preaching in whatever
                    languages that were necessary for the audience to get the message of Christ. However, it’s clear
                    that God once again performs a miraculous event as <span class="bold">verses 44-48</span> tell us
                    that there were believers
                    and unbelievers hearing this preaching. Then just like Pentecost the language barriers were broken
                    by gift of the Holy Spirit so that all could hear and more importantly understand the message of the gospel.</p>

                <p>So, when you put God’s holy scriptures together in their relative context; it clearly helps you
                    define truth vs lies when it comes to these continued false tongues preachers and teachers. My hope
                    is you will no longer fall for the manipulation of scripture, such as <span class="bold">Joel
                        2:28</span> or <span class="bold">Acts 2:17</span> which
                    are often used as validation for these self-indulgent heretical, money hungry, snake oil sellers.
                    Because these two scriptures have nothing to do with tongues, but about prophesy and visions that
                    will occur during the tribulation period (which is a study for another time). Now just in case after
                    this study you are still confused, just use these markers as wisdom to know the truth. </p>

                <p><span class="bold">Tongues was intended by God as a sign to unbelievers</span> – to draw them to salvation in Jesus. Think of
                    the impact hearing God’s word in your native tongue from a foreigner who shouldn’t know or speak it.
                </p>

                <p><span class="bold">Tongues were meant to edify the church (body of Christ)</span> – which means to instruct or improve someone
                    morally or intellectually. Where does gibberish nonsense fit here?</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Tongues was meant to magnify God</span> – to increase God’s importance and to give Him glory.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Tongues must be interpreted</span> – If someone can’t understand how can they get a clear picture and
                    purpose of the message of Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Where ever God gave the gift of language, he also gave the gift of translation</span></p>

                <p><span class="bold">Languages help the gospel reflect that God’s salvation is available to all</span> - not just the Jews but
                    even to us Gentiles
                </p>

                <p><span class="bold">God has never spoken to man in an unknown language or gibberish</span></p>

                <p>Lastly, understanding today this super natural gift of human language tongues is not necessary. Not
                    that God can’t do as He sees fit at any time, but God has already equipped and given us the tools to
                    use language in this day and time to communicate and share His word. Also, the gift to understand a
                    foreign language is not for everyone but again not necessary because you or anyone else can request
                    the services of an interpreter to communicate with whomever you desire. We now even have smart
                    phones, computers and internet that will translate any language for you. According to Ethnologue, there are
                    currently 7,117 languages spoken around the world as of 2021.</p>

                <p>So, the next time you are in a church or someplace where a person supposedly got the “holy ghost” and
                    it prompted them to speak in gibberish. Please by all means politely stand up raise your hand and
                    ask for them or others to interpret what was said. I can only imagine the response you or I would
                    get. Because remember our foundational scripture, <span class="bold">1 Corinthians 14:33</span> “For God is not the author of
                    confusion but of peace”. God desires for us as believers to live His word, to reflect His word, to
                    share His word, but more importantly to keep His word true. He also most certainly wants us all,
                    from believer to unbeliever to have access and understanding of His word.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Romans 1:19 says</span>, “They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them”. NLT</p>
