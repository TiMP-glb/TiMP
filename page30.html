                <p>Continuing this topic from our last teaching, I thought I would note how this very question for me
                    plays a role in how God uses me to disseminate His word to TiMP Nation. You may notice a times when
                    coming to the site weekly there is no new message or teaching. Well, the reason for this is fairly
                    simple, God through The Holy Spirit has not given me anything to teach or bring into your
                    perspective view. So, rather than take the religious approach and just put something out here for
                    the sake of pleasing you the audience, I choose to be obedient to the direction of the Holy Spirit.
                    There are also times when life simply gets in the way, especially during this time of Covid-19 and
                    managing young children, work and our home. Sometimes my alone time with God, prayer and study are
                    not as consistent as I would like due to the afore mentioned impacts. Now, you may be wondering why
                    is Greg sharing all of this with us? </p>

                <p>I think it’s important we keep it truthful about our life and journey as Christians and not try and
                    paint an unrealistic picture. I especially think this view should weigh most heavy to those of us
                    whom God patiently task with the responsibility of proclaiming the truth of His gospel to the world.
                    Maybe some pastors, preachers or other teachers out there try to come off more than Holy at every
                    turn to world. As for me, I’m not this spiritual teacher with some halo around my head who found
                    Jesus all these years ago and now the wind blows every time I enter a room. Therefore, it’s
                    imperative that I ensure you all understand I am not without flaws or failures. In fact, most of my
                    life has been just that, partly because I spent most of it trying to please myself or others rather
                    than what was pleasing unto The Lord. Heck, even now being in this ministry space I find myself
                    battling with my thoughts or my eye sight yet it humbles me to realize how imperfect I am and how
                    perfect my Father is. It also humbles me to be at a place in life where I’m fully aware of those
                    flaws, weaknesses and failures and every day blessed to realize I am a sinner saved by His grace.
                    More importantly that Christ dwells in me and thus rescues me from myself for my faith is in
                    Him.</p>

                <p>I’m a disciple of The Lord Jesus because I no longer desire to be what I want to be, but what He
                    desires of me for His will and purpose. If you notice, I often call out the church, I try and be
                    mindful that not all are afraid to have these contrite conversations with those of you who are saved
                    or with those seeking to accept Christ in their life. But many from t.v. evangelicals, mega
                    churches, internet zealots, to your local neighborhood church, try and sell you on religion as they
                    define it and its transactional value in your life. That if you do this or that, then God as part of
                    the transaction owes you something in return. Now here is the best part, and that this transaction
                    between you and God will be abundantly in your favor, if you follow this so called prophetic or
                    prosperity doctrine they have laid out before you. This is where as very large portion of people
                    around the world say, sign me up! Well, let’s be clear the Word of God (The Bible) makes no mention
                    that God owes us anything! That’s because a real relationship with Jesus is not a religious
                    transaction it is intimately purposeful for His glory alone. For He and He alone is worthy of all
                    power, praise, honor and thanksgiving. <span class="bold">JRevelation 4:11</span></p>

                <p>Yet the fact remains religion may fool you to think that your prosperity is on the way or believing
                    you or someone else can somehow predict the future. However, a relationship with Jesus will help
                    understand that your life will be filled with trials and tribulations. However, this is great for
                    you as testing your faith breeds patience if you see the joy in the process <span
                        class="bold">(James 1:2)</span>. You will
                    come to understand the future is already done and accounted for in the Word of God which is complete
                    and final. His word is infallible which means it never has or ever will fail or be incorrect.
                    Therefore, when choosing a relationship and life of obedience unto Christ you will give up a lot
                    more of this world than you will gain. </p>

                <p>In the book of <span class="bold">Mark 10:17-22</span> we get introduced to the Rich Young Ruler. He is a prime example of this
                    Relationship versus Religion topic. So here is this young wealthy guy by all accounts and he’s
                    knowledgeable in legalism and all the religious ways. He then runs and kneels at Jesus and likely in
                    all sincerity asks, “What can I do to have eternal life”? Like a vast majority of people, he thought
                    he could do something to earn this priviledge? Some today are still misled in this thinking. Let’s
                    see maybe give a large sum of money to the church. Go to church every week and don’t miss a Sunday.
                    Oh, wait don’t break any of the commandments and be good to my family. One of these good deeds is
                    sure to get me in. However, Jesus starts to challenge him first in recognizing no one is good except
                    God. Then Jesus taps into his superficial nature by running down the commandments because obviously
                    the Rich Ruler knew them. Thus, the young man was all over that “Teacher, I’ve been following those
                    since I was young”. No problem there check, likely with a wink and a thumbs up. Now obviously this
                    is untrue as Jesus had just told Him no one is good except God. However, this is the religion mind
                    set of checking off these boxes as noted in part 1 of this series. Then we see Jesus showing
                    compassion (love) towards the young man because he was sincere but he was spiritually lost. His only
                    connection to God had come through religion not a relationship. So, when Jesus basically tells him
                    to give up everything you have and follow me. The Rich Young Ruler walked away, because let’s face
                    it once he realized he would have to give up all his earthly wealth. That was too high a price to
                    pay. The moral here is Jesus was exposing what was truly in his heart. You see, saving face and
                    acting blameless when it came to sin in his life and clearly disobeying a direct command from Jesus
                    regarding his possessions. Clearly showed what he valued most which caused him to miss out on
                    salvation and eternal life. </p>

                <p>I sincerely hope you all begin to recognize the difference in a relationship with Jesus versus being
                    in religion toward Him. I hope you all start to seek Him more intimately and trust me, He will do a
                    marvelous work in you. </p>
