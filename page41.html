                <p>Hello TiMP Nation I hope all have been blessed and safe. We are finally here at part 3 of our series
                    "Obedience Supersedes Free Will". I can’t stress enough how strongly I feel about taking our time to
                    study through these teachings. This is why I do my best to be obedient to God’s Holy Spirit in
                    knowing when it’s time to move forward with something new, and when it’s not. I know most may be
                    used to the idea that something new should be coming out every week. Now in some cases it may happen
                    if directed. I could of course do it just to satisfy my audience or self, but would we truly be
                    learning, taking it in and growing?</p>

                <p>With that said, if you recall from part 2 we need to come to a growth understanding that true freedom
                    is found in obedience to God’s word. Everything else outside of that is actually bondage and if not
                    corrected will lead to eternal damnation! I know this sounds harsh but that is the reality of free
                    will as it does not desire to please God, it desires to please our sinful nature. Now you could say
                    well no, I use my free will to follow God. Actually if we are being honest that’s not what we do at
                    all. Only conviction of the heart leads one to repentance and obedience to Christ.</p>

                <p>If you recall the people of Nineveh were a free willing people until they heard the word of God come
                    from Jonah. Prior to that they were not using their free will to seek out God. They were using it
                    just like we all do, seeking out what's good for self. Let’s look at <span class="bold">Romans
                        6:23</span> which is a very
                    popular scripture. Simply put the efforts of our free will (sin nature) will lead to death. This
                    verse is speaking to our spiritual eternal death as consequence for being slaves to sin. Thus, God
                    in His infinite grace was purposed in saving the Ninevites from this outcome. Now you may be saying
                    well how can one fix this dire situation today? As God is not likely to send a giant fish to swallow
                    some one up to get your attention. Well, that same verse also gives you the remedy. It says BUT the
                    gift of God, the “gift”refers to Jesus and what He did out of obedience to the will of His Father
                    for us undeserving sinners. That only salvation which come through Christ, is there freedom and
                    eternal life. In other words you can avoid spiritual death by believing and accepting Christ. Now
                    there should be a desire if belonging to Christ, that wants to be in bondage or a slave. But it
                    should be to righteousness not free will (sin). </p>

                <p>Read <span class="bold">Romans 6:16-23</span> in its context. Paul uses a master/slave analogy so
                    that we grasp the spiritual
                    understanding. The Greek word here for slave is “doulos” and the word for lord or master is
                    “kurios”. Often times we think we know what is best for ourselves. That the images and ideas we have
                    for how to live our lives should be all about what we want. That what we want can be anything we so
                    desire because if I’m happy then that’s all that matters. This is nothing new for men or women. This
                    mentality has been applied to lifestyles, sexual orientation and public consumption for centuries.
                    In today’s time we see the disobedience and dominance of free will which leads to sinful behavior in
                    more prevalent form due to social media. Also, the removal of God being acknowledged from most
                    aspects of society. However, the Bible says in all our getting, get understanding <span
                        class="bold">Proverbs 4:7.</span></p>

                <p>Clearly there is something we all need to understand and accept and here it is. God will never change
                    to adapt to our free willing whims, pleasures and desires. As a matter of fact God is eternally
                    unchanging in His desire that we be obedient to what He as already said! Therefore, the only way to
                    be in a true relationship with Him is to believe in His son Jesus and keep His commandments as our
                    original study text <span class="bold">John 14:15</span> reminds us. My prayer is that we all humble ourselves from this study
                    to be a doulos who desires to be an obedient servant to our kurios who is God the Father. Amen.</p>
