                <p>God’s grace, covering and blessings to you all TiMP Nation on this Sunday. Now let’s dive right into
                    part 2 of “Already Been Defined”. In part 1 we clearly saw from our study text <span
                        class="bold">Genesis 1:27-28</span> what
                    God defined his creation as man and woman. Which I for one am glad because there is nothing more
                    amazing than a woman. My wife in particular, in case anybody is wondering. We also looked at the
                    world’s attempt however to redefine this natural order. One of the key factors we need to
                    acknowledge as to why some men and women are trying to redefine their gender or gender roles is free
                    will. We touched on this in a prior series and how free will is a platform or spring board for our
                    sin nature. In <span class="bold">Romans 8:6-8</span> Paul writes, “So letting your sinful nature
                    control your mind leads to
                    death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace. For the sinful nature is
                    always hostile to God. It never did obey God’s laws, and it never will. That’s why those who are
                    still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.”</p>

                <p>Therefore free willing sin puts one in the perspective that they have a right to choose who they want
                    to be or how they want to do something. They have no desire to obey God or follow what he has
                    clearly defined. Now let’s be clear this applies to any sin we have ruling our lives not just
                    homosexuality. Therefore, if a man wakes up tomorrow and wants to “try” an be a woman so be it. If a
                    woman decides her path is to “try” an be a man then that’s ok too. The danger here which is so often
                    over looked is this puts them or you at odds with God. However, the present day perpetuated view is
                    that you can indeed be a homosexual or redefine your gender and still serve and have a relationship
                    with God and His son Jesus Christ. I’m here to plainly tell you, you can not! Remember this biblical
                    principle, loving God means obeying what He says is right and what he says is wrong before Him and
                    doing so is not a burden to you. <span class="bold">1 John 5:3.</span></p>

                <p>This is the blatant assault of sexual immorality on the world and in particular young people today.
                    Which is why so many are growing up confused on who they are or what is right and what is wrong. God
                    is not evident to them because he’s either not being taught or being presented as this anything goes
                    God. Even some churches are joining in on this notion. That being contrary to what God defined as
                    man and woman is not only cool and acceptable, but that God himself is just fine with it. Some have
                    even went so far as to blaspheme God and say that He made them that way! You see it everywhere, from
                    movies, commercials, music even kids cartoons can’t escape it. Homosexuality is being given an
                    unprecedented platform because man says it’s the right thing to do. Again my stance is no it is not!
                    God’s word is very clear on this subject and path if you so choose to take it or even support it. I
                    want to bring emphasis to the word “choose” before we move on into what God’s says specific to the
                    subject of homosexuality, LBGQT, gay and so forth. I want to be very upfront and direct here. If you
                    are reading this and you are living these lifestyles or know someone who is and condoning it. This
                    is a lifestyle decision by choice and is a direct result of sin and deceit of the enemy Satan. <span
                        class="bold">2
                        Corinthians 4:3-4</span> If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil, it is hidden only
                    from people
                    who are perishing. In their case the god (Satan) of this world has blinded the minds of the
                    unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the
                    image of God.”</p>

                <p>We live in a non-confrontational world, where most of us are not calling ourselves out on our mess,
                    neither is anyone else calling us out in most cases. I like to call this the egg shell syndrome.
                    Where we are to fragile to handle the truth, let alone God’s defined standards. Thus from every part
                    of the world, we see appeasement agendas for the sins of the people being the norm, rather than
                    upholding God’s biblical principles.</p>

                <p>Not only did God define a man and a woman, but he is direct on how he views the act of homosexuality
                    and it consequences. In Leviticus which is one of the 5 books of the law (Torah). Starting in
                    chapter 18 we see laws of sexual morality laid out. In <span class="bold">18:22</span> God has Moses
                    state that homosexuality
                    which is immoral, is an abomination (meaning disgrace, detestable, disgusting). In chapter 20 verse
                    13 God repeats this, along with they shall surely be put to death. Here God is defining the
                    consequences for violating the prohibited sexual sins. <span class="bold">1 Corinthians 6:18</span>,
                    Paul warns, “Run from
                    sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a
                    sin against your own body.” I find it sad that most homosexuals will tell you, they are free, living
                    their best life and they love themselves. However, all the while they clearly don’t understand the
                    harm they are inflicting upon themselves every day they don’t turn from their wicked ways.</p>

                <p>I believe I asked once before imagine if God’s justified reaction to our sins was immediate? What
                    must be understood is not that God is slow in His promise to respond and punish wickedness but that
                    He is patient (merciful) towards you not hoping you would perish (be put death) but that you would
                    come to repentance, which means (sincere regret or remorse for sinful disobedience), <span class="bold">2 Peter 3:9</span>.</p>

                <p>Lastly, when we come to part 3 in a two Sundays we will look at God’s anger at sin and that redefining gender or having same sex relations is in fact unnatural.</p>
