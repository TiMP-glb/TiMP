                <p>Blessings to you all on this Sunday TiMP Nation, it’s of course been several weeks since we last
                    spoke. I’ve been on a bit of a hiatus, not due to anything necessarily wrong. Mostly due to the many
                    day to day responsibilities that often take away from my opportunity for quiet with God. Therefore,
                    when I know and understand I’m unable to put my full foot forward in teaching, I stay patient,
                    knowing this is the greatest of my responsibilities. My wife and I have discussed an alternate
                    solution in order to help remedy distractions for me. So hopefully in the coming days this will
                    prove to assist in having the ministry back to a more consistent holy spirt lead approach.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, I hope that all of you out there were still seeking wisdom from God and abiding
                    yourselves in His word. Being confident that in this crazy chaotic world the truth of scripture will
                    and is the only sustaining foundation you can depend on. If you are having any trouble in finding
                    content always know the website has plenty of content to read, re-read and study.</p>

                <p>With that let’s get into it! Today will be the final piece to our Hebrews study and it will be brief.
                    The reason for this brief approach is that we have covered in the prior 4 lessons the culmination of
                    what Hebrews it securely pointing to in <span class="bold">Hebrews 11:1</span>. The particular piece
                    of scripture is the
                    central premise of the Christian believer. As we noted and broke down prior concerning this verse
                    and the key elements of Substance, Hope, Evidence, when put together they produce this powerful
                    action called FAITH! Well one might ask what is this Faith and how does it apply to being a
                    Christian? Well, here is what 1 Peter 1:3-9 says:</p>

                <p><span class="bold">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to
                    His abundant mercy has
                    begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <span
                        class="bold">4</span> to an
                    inheritance [b]incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
                    <span class="bold">5</span> who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be
                    revealed in the last
                    time.
                </p>

                <p><span class="bold">6</span> In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be,
                    you have been [c]grieved by
                    various trials, <span class="bold">7</span> that the genuineness of your faith, being much more
                    precious than gold that
                    perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of
                    Jesus Christ, <span class="bold">8</span> whom having not [d]seen you love. Though now you do not
                    see Him, yet believing, you
                    rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, <span class="bold">9</span> receiving the end of
                    your faith—the salvation of
                    your souls.</p>

                <p>Now many will tell you to invest in bitcoin, the stock market or even yourself. However, you just
                    read that Faith, is a more precious commodity than gold or anything in this world you could place
                    value on. More importantly it will endure and produce a heavenly inheritance! So, to all my brothers
                    and sisters, there is no better reward than exercising your faith in Christ Jesus, the payoff is
                    immeasurable. Thus our 4th and final significant word in our study is of course Faith, however it
                    breaks down much simpler and plainer than all the others, FAITH = <span class="bold">FOR ANYTHING I
                        TRUST HIM!</span> Now be
                    mindful when you catch this meaning, it has less to do about anything you want and more to do about
                    anything He wants for you. I’m going to say that again, this meaning has less to do about anything
                    you want and more to do about anything He wants for you.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Ephesians 3:20</span></p>

                <p><span class="bold">20</span> Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to
                    the power that works in us, <span class="bold">21</span> to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations,
                    forever and ever. Amen.</p>
