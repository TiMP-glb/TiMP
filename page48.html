                <p>It’s Sunday TiMP Nation! As always, I hope all has been well with everyone, safe and blessed.
                    Hopefully, you enjoyed and used our pause week to really review and study parts 1 and 2 of our
                    series “Hebrews”.</p>

                <p>We are back this week with Part 3 and the “warning”, yes, we are just going to jump straight in the
                    pool here! This portion of our study will also be shorter than the others to come. In thinking over
                    this portion and seeking wisdom. One thought stood out a warning normally does not come with too
                    much commentary. Why you might ask? Well, the sole purpose is so that you heed the warning. Usually
                    when you find a warning label it’s pretty direct and specific. Even the warning siren for severe or
                    dangerous weather is direct. We all know that sound and when we hear that sound it means possible
                    danger is approaching. Well, here we are in <span class="bold">Hebrews chapter 2</span> and
                    immediately the writer warns us!
                    Before we take a further step let’s get a clear understanding of a “warning”: the Greek word for
                    warning is προειδοποίηση (preheidope). Now from this word you get a few other related words such as
                    monition, caution and admonition (which is an act or action of admonishing; authoritative counsel or
                    warning). Which is exactly what the Hebrew writer is trying to convey here in this passage.</p>

                <p>The writer also very plainly explains how to recognize a warning, you must take earnest or careful
                    attention to hear and listen to the truth. Most times we think hearing and listening are the same
                    but they are not. Hearing if you are blessed to have it, is one of your many senses giving by God.
                    However, listening is a skill, which you must put into practice. When one consistently practices
                    listening, they gain understanding and wisdom. Simply put hearing is something you have; listening
                    is something you do. This reminds me of something the respected and deceased Pastor S.M. Lockridge
                    would say. (If you have a chance look him up). When we look in <span class="bold">James 1:22</span>
                    we see James making the same point, “be doers of the word, and not hearers only. Otherwise, you are
                    deceiving yourselves.</p>

                <p>One the best examples I can give you of how hearing and listening can be visualized is through my
                    wife. I’m sure she will not mind me mentioning this because before she gave her life to Christ, we
                    would have discussions about music. Specifically, these talks would center on the lyrics to some
                    songs in our younger days trying to be hip in the streets. I was always one who pays attention to
                    the words to songs …. I was actually listening. My wife however would just hear the beat and not
                    recognize the lyrics. I would sometimes say, “Hey honey that’s not a good song the words are not
                    good”, her reply would be, “I’m not paying attention to what they are saying”. So, here is the
                    Hebrew writer giving caution to ensure we listen to the words accompanying the music so to speak.
                    That we don’t just get caught of up in the beat and start drifting away in our Christian walk or
                    after hearing the truth of salvation afforded to us through Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>Now, there is also another component that comes along with a warning if it’s neglected, and that is
                    consequences. The Greek word for consequences is Συνέπειες (synepeies), now from this word you also
                    get a few other related words, such as effects, repercussions, impact etc. Therefore, when we look
                    back to the days of old in biblical times disobedience to the law and initial covenant with God
                    brought swift judgement from God. So just imagine now that God the Father has sent His only begotten
                    Son, to suffer death for our sins and resurrected to life for our justification <span
                        class="bold">(Romans 4:25)</span>. Thus,
                    if He were to be neglected by us, how much more severe God’s judgement will be upon those who reject
                    Christ. In reading chapter 2 you find where God had Jesus become a little lower than the angels
                    (this is reflective of Jesus as a physical human being). However, this was necessary so that all
                    things would be under subjection and the feet or our wonderful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>So, in closing this “warning” is to remind us to hold on tight to the truth we now know. To hold
                    steadfast to obedience in Christ, to not become adrift like a boat tossed to and fro in the sea. But
                    as my Big Mama use to say, “To know, that you know, that you know, that Jesus Christ is Lord”. Just
                    as important is that we also tell others about Christ, warning everyone and teaching everyone with
                    all the wisdom God has given us. <span class="bold">Colossians 1:28.</span></p>

                <p><span class="bold">Amen.  Much love to you all and have a blessed week.</span></p>
