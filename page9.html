                <p>We have been immersed in the Daniel series for the past five weeks, but we will use today as an opportunity
                to honor “Moms”. As a matter of fact, I hope to put a slightly unique perspective on what it means to be
                a mom. More importantly to be blessed to have one. Even if your mom is no longer with you, I hope this
                brief journey will bring about fond memories and an even greater appreciation. If you are a mom, son or
                daughter struggling in your relationship with one another, the hope is that this will introduce healing
                and forgiveness.</p>

                <p>What does it mean to be a mother? Well, I must confess I have no clue because fortunately I’m a man and a father.
                Plus women are way tougher then we are, you know the whole child birth thing, yeah I will pass on that.
                However, here is what I understand from man’s dictionary definition. It’s a woman (female) in relation to
                her child, children or offspring. She brings up a child in care, affection and excessively looking after
                to protect. This either occurs by giving birth to or adopting a child or children. As you can see by
                this description, she is pretty awesome already. However, this does not even scratch the surface on what
                God has to say on the matter. With a little research you will find that God’s word mentions mothers 376
                times in the Bible. Most times its directly someone’s mother and/or relationally metaphorical, like we
                see in <span class="bold">Genesis 17:16</span> related to Sarah the wife of Abraham (she will be the “mother of many nations”). As
                I was seeking God this week and trying to wrap my head around mothers and their esteemed essential place
                in our hearts. I first went back to how God so eloquently had the writer describe in his poem their
                worth and value. Read <span class="bold">Proverbs 31:25-30</span>, “She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the
                days to come. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. She watches over the
                affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children arise and call her
                blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.
                Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.” Now for
                context when you read the entirety of chapter 31, it’s speaks to a wife and mother of noble character.
                Please note if you are no longer a wife this still applies to you as a mother.</p>

                <p>What a powerful passage of God’s word, but here is the part I hope all mothers clearly recognize. Your
                whole being and projection of who you are is nothing without fear of the Lord. Now God is not asking you
                to look at Him as if He’s a horror movie monster. His intent here is that you turn your heart to
                reverence, humility, respect and love of His authority. By doing so, it allows you to reach the full
                heights of motherhood as this fear spiritually instructs you to the blessing of your true purpose. To
                raise up your children to know that Jesus Christ is Lord <span class="bold">(Proverbs 22:6)</span>. This should be the foundation and
                the standard by which you navigate in your life, not the possible consideration.</p>

                <p>Obviously, we know mothers play a key primary role in God’s plan to bring forth life. This is why Adam
                named the bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, Eve meaning “mother of all who live”. God gave me an
                analogy of just how amazing “Moms” really are. Man is the seed giver and his role is <span class="bold">vital</span>, but the
                woman is strength and her role is <span class="bold">crucial</span> to the process. Do yourself a favor and look up these two
                words to understand the difference. You see without a mother’s decisive fortitude to bear the load there
                would be no you or me. Behind the scenes God in his infinite wisdom molds and creates inside the womb.
                This handy work is by design and complex with no flaws or mistakes <span class="bold">(Psalms 139:13-14)</span>. Then a mother in
                spite of the pain, pressure and changes to come, carries forth His vision. Even those who take on the
                role and responsibility of mother from those who are not fit for the long road ahead, are just as, if
                not more amazing themselves! They are willing to open their lives and hearts to be used of God to carry
                forth the vision and purpose for that child or children.</p>

                <p>Lastly, I want to thank and honor all the important women in my life. My mom for surrendering to God’s plan even in the middle of adversity
                and doing it alone. She persevered and set the example for God being the head of my life. To my other
                mom for loving me just like I’m her own without any reservations or laws, just her heart. Not many can say they have two
                blessed mothers in their corner daily, but I can. To my awesome sister who just became a first-time mom, it’s such
                a privilege to see her heart pouring into my precious niece. To all my Tias (aunts) and Primas (cousins)
                who are all amazing mothers as well. Now to my incredible wife who has been the backbone in raising
                three wonderful children. Watching how she gives, cares and surrounds them in love is just beyond me. I
                likely could ask for a lot of things but I could not ask for a better mother to our children. I’m
                excited to watch God continue to move in her life, simply put this house would not be a home without
                her.</p>

                <p>Happiness to all the wonderful women God has blessed to love, nurture, raise and care for His gift of
                children because truly every day is Mother’s Day!</p>

            <!-- From Greg’s TiMP Garden:
                Our world today is all about being hurry. From ordering online, daily travel to something as simple as
                saying hello. The act patience has become a relic of stories told in ancient times. It's ironic God tells us
                that being patient benefits us greatly. However, he never mentions being in a hurry producing any
                lasting
                effective outcome. Proverbs 14:29 -->
