                <p>Hopefully you read and studied Daniel chapters 1 and 2 with a new found set of eyes. If so, you
                    noticed Daniel, his friends as well as the other captives had to meet certain criteria to serve in
                    the palace of king Nebuchadnezzar. They had to be good looking no scars or physical abnormalities,
                    fit and young. This meant that most including Daniel were roughly between the ages of 14-17 by most
                    estimates. They then received 3 years of Babylonian training to serve the king. Now, Daniel and his
                    friends were considered the best and brightest and were between the ages of 17-20 when they began
                    their official service to the king’s palace. We also learn of the king’s cultural brainwashing by
                    changing the names of those he takes captive. Let’s take a look at what’s in a name, both their
                    original God given names and what it was changed to in Babylonian. For the sake of our study we will
                    only put a bit more additional breakdown around Daniel but will provide the meaning of others for
                    reference and context. Also, take note on how their God given names will play a major role in how
                    they navigate their circumstances. </p>


                <p><i><u>God given name -vs- Changed name under Babylonian captivity:</u></i></p>

                <p><span class="bold">Daniel</span> (who was from King David’s royal family) means <span
                        class="bold">“God
                        is my judge”.</span> In native Hebrew the name would be spelled Daniyel:
                    <i><span class="bold">Dan</span> = judge, <span class="bold">i</span> = my, <span
                            class="bold">el</span> = God.</i>
                    You may notice or heard of <i><u>el</u></i> before which comes from <i>Elohim</i> which
                    is God in Hebrew. In
                    Latin
                    <i><u>el</u></i> is a masculine singular pronoun for He, The/Thee.
                    Daniel’s name is changed to <span class="bold"><u>Bel</u>teshazzar</span> which means
                    <span class="bold">“<u>Bel</u> Protect the king”</span> (Bel = pagan
                    god).</p>


                <p><span class="bold">Hananiah</span> means <span class="bold">“The Lord is Gracious”</span> changed
                    to: <span class="bold">Shadrach</span> which means <span class="bold">“Command of
                        Aku”</span> the
                    name Aku is Babylonian for “moon god”.</p>


                <p><span class="bold">Mishael</span> means <span class="bold">“Who is like the Lord”</span> changed
                    to: <span class="bold">Meshach</span> which means <span class="bold">“Who is what
                        Aku Is”</span>
                    again Aku is “moon god”.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Azariah</span> means <span class="bold">“The Lord is my Helper”</span> changed
                    to: <span class="bold">Abed-nego</span> which means <span class="bold">“Servant
                        of Nego”</span> the
                    name Nego or Nebo/Nabu is Babylonian for “vegetation god” and
                    patron of the art of writing.</p>

                <p>Lastly, for your reference Babylonian king <span class="bold">Nebuchadnezzar</span> name means,
                            <span class="bold">“Nebo protect your servant”.</span></p>


                <p>Now let’s learn the significance of chapters 1 and 2. At this point Daniel and his friends are
                    well
                    on their way to standing up for God whom they serve. For very young men, they have shown great
                    strength, faith and God has also given them favor in the king’s kingdom. We also learn
                    Nebuchadnezzar has his first of 2 dreams. God has gifted Daniel with supernatural ability to
                    interpret dreams. Why? Well this is where the fun starts, so to speak. In chapter <span
                        class="bold">2:20-23</span> we get
                            a peek into what the book of Daniel is all about. The night prior to going before the
                            king he
                            has
                            a vision (dream) and the secrets of the king’s 1st dream is revealed. The bible then
                            says,
                            Daniel
                            praises God and it’s in this praise we see that God is in control of all things and
                            every king
                            (leader) or kingdom (nation) is subject His authority. This is obviously in contrast to
                            what
                            most in power or authority think even in the world today.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, in chapter <span class="bold">2:39-45</span> as Daniel is explaining the king’s 1st
                            dream. He speaks of 5
                            kingdoms which will come and go but the last kingdom to come will be eternal. In verse
                            45 we see
                            the word
                            “stone” this is reference to the Messiah. In the same verse “cut out of the mountain
                            without
                            hands” is reference to the Messiah’s origin being from God and not man. Now let’s relate
                            this to
                            the
                            new testament so that is makes sense. <span class="bold">Luke 20:17-18</span> “the stone
                                    that the builders rejected…”.
                                    Remember, Jerusalem as well as some today rejected and still reject Jesus as the
                                    Messiah
                                    (Savior). The
                                    Bible however clearly tells us that the origin of Jesus was with God the Father
                                    from the very
                                    beginning, <span class="bold">John 1:1</span> “In the beginning was the Word…”.
                                            In as much as it is clear that Jesus was
                                            sent by God
                                            and not man <span class="bold">(John 3:16, John 17:3, Colossians
                                                1:15-17)</span>. So not only is Daniel revealing to
                                                    Nebuchadnezzar the demise of his empire and those to come. He is
                                                    testifying to the ultimate
                                                    everlasting sovereign throne of the King of all Kings Jesus!</p>
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Read Chapters 3-4</span> As we begin this week’s read, it gets much hotter and
                Daniel deals with Nebuchadnezzar's 2nd dream.</p>

            <!-- From Greg’s TiMP Garden:
                Our world today is all about being hurry. From ordering online, daily travel to something as simple as
                saying hello. The act patience has become a relic of stories told in ancient times. It's ironic God tells us
                that being patient benefits us greatly. However, he never mentions being in a hurry producing any
                lasting
