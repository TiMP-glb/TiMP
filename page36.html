                <p>It’s Sunday TiMP Nation and hopefully you have all been safe, healthy and blessed. Well, we are back
                    with our series on “Glory in the Cross”. Now, hopefully you took the time to read our study text in
                    between our Resurrection Sunday pause. If you recall from our introduction lesson, our scriptural
                    text was taken from <span class="bold">Galatians 6:11-15</span>. Paul is concluding his letter to
                    the churches in Galatia and
                    noting why we should look to the cross of Jesus. If you noticed in my prior writing, the intent was
                    to take our focus off the material or symbolic cross and place our focus on Jesus and most
                    importantly the act of what happened at the cross. It’s vital regarding the path we are going to
                    take in this study that you get this point. It’s the same point Paul was trying to drive home to
                    world and most certainly believers in his writings hundreds of years ago.</p>

                <p>Some of you may recall a few years back God had me teach on the cross. I recall God had me make the
                    point that even those who are not saved wear crosses and so how would one really tell the difference
                    between an unsaved or saved person. The point was the cross you wear or place in your home is
                    actually an indicator of nothing. Now in that time the Holy Spirit has tremendously blessed in
                    evolving my learning and understanding towards the material cross or symbolic cross. In my
                    description of how I saw glory in the cross from our last lesson, some of you may have taken it as
                    the cross is important, so therefore you need that. Others I hope may have noticed I was not
                    describing a cross at all nor was I elevating one. I was describing Jesus and what His actions at
                    the cross represented to me personally.</p>

                <p>At this point some of you are either wondering or questioning why am I taking issue with the material
                    or symbolic cross. Assuredly the cross as we’ve been taught, should be revered and to much a degree
                    worshiped and elevated above most things. Most of us as I once did, hold or have held the cross in
                    the highest regard for our entire lives. It’s quite literally engrained in the fabric of who we are
                    as Christians. Even the world if not saved or a professed believer acknowledges God through a cross.
                    I mean let’s be clear, crosses are everywhere. We find them in most churches, homes, cars, statues,
                    schools and even on some of our bodies, whether as a tattoo or an adorned necklace. Even I have one
                    on my arm and personally and spiritually regret getting one. I even had to repent and ask your
                    forgiveness for putting one on this website, thus it has been removed. Why might you ask? Because NO
                    ONE who is a BELIEVER in JESUS CHRIST, THE RISEN SAVIOR and Son of GOD THE FATHER should want to
                    have anything to do with a cross! Except to give God glory for His victory over it and be willing to
                    die on it in pursuit of following Jesus! One of the most misunderstood scriptural text among many is
                    <span class="bold">Luke 9:23-26</span>, Jesus is teaching on the cost of discipleship and says to
                    the multitudes gathered,
                    23“Then He said to them all, whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their
                    cross daily and follow me. 24For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,
                    but whoever loses their life for me will save it. 25What good is it for someone to gain the whole
                    world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self? 26Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of
                    Man will be ashamed of them when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the
                    Father and of the holy angels”. On the surface it looks like Jesus is speaking to common
                    difficulties, burdens, worry, even the weight of sins in our lives. Also, most by seeing the word
                    cross interpret as reference to a material or even symbolic cross. But actually, this teaching
                    refers to dying to one’s self. This has both spiritual and literal meaning from Jesus. In other
                    words, through salvation in Jesus Christ spiritually killing your sinful self/nature and
                    surrendering one’s self to the authority and lordship of Jesus Christ. This denying of one self was
                    getting rid of the condemned person you were before accepting Jesus and everything that comes along
                    with serving Him. This service may literally include walking away from everything you love and hold
                    dear, mother, father, brother, sister, kids, spouse, money, fame etc... Even the willingness to be
                    humiliated and lose your life to uphold the gospel and the name of Jesus. We find this teaching
                    repeated throughout the new testament (ref. <span class="bold">Matthew 16:24-27, Mark 8:34-38, Luke
                        14:27</span>).</p>

                <p>With a bit of research, you will find the word cross or reference to it, around 27-45 times in
                    biblical scripture. In every instance it was to foretell what would happen or what happened to
                    Jesus, and that was death at the cross. More importantly the sacrifice, glory and victory of what
                    Jesus accomplished at the cross. What you will not find is any reference to anyone in scripture
                    wearing or adorning a cross in anyway as a representation of God, Jesus or the establishing of the
                    Christian faith. In every instance the bible is clear the only focus to be carried with you is
                    Jesus. Not some carved out wooden or metal trinket. As a matter of fact, God’s word takes the
                    opposite approach, here is what God had to say in the old testament, this was not only a direct
                    command to the Israelites but to us today as well. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,
                    or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in
                    the water under earth: 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy
                    God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and
                    fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
                    keep my commandments <span class="bold">Exodus 20:4-6 KJV.</span></p>

                <p>Here is what God says in <span class="bold">Isaiah 42:8</span> “I am the LORD; that is my name! <span class="red-text">I will not give my glory to
                    anyone else, nor share my praise with carved idols</span> <span class="bold">(Also read Leviticus 26:1)</span>. Yes, having a cross
                    or a cross depicting Jesus on it, or rosery, or anything else for that matter from candles to virgin
                    Mary is idolatry!! Now some may say that was old testament we can do things differently since Jesus
                    came. Well, here is what God says in the new testament, 1Now the Holy Spirit tells us clearly that
                    in last times some will turn away from the true faith; they will follow deceptive spirits and
                    teachings that come from demons. 2These people are hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are
                    dead. <span class="bold">1 Timothy 4:1-2 NLT</span>. Now coming back to Paul in the book of <span class="bold">Acts chapter 17</span> we find him
                    preaching in Athens also debating with and trying to reason to the Jews, God fearing Gentiles and
                    philosophers. Why? Because everywhere he looked, they had idols in the city. Paul is trying to tell
                    them about Jesus and His resurrection. In <span class="bold">verses 27-29 KJV</div>, He tells them Jesus’s purpose and why He
                    came and in <span class="bold">verse 29</span> he clearly says, “Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not
                    to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device”.
                    See <span class="bold">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</span> idolaters will not inherit the kingdom of God. So again, when we look at
                    the teaching in Galatians our scriptural text and even in Acts, Paul is not finding glory in a
                    material or symbolic cross. No, he is finding glory in what Jesus did at the cross not only for him
                    but for us all, and no idol image was necessary to remind him of that.</p>

                <p>Next week we will look at part 3 of “Glory in the Cross” the history and origins of the cross we have
                    held so dear, what it stood for and where it comes from. Here’s a hint, it did not come from God!</p>
