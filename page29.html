                <p>Have you ever asked yourself this question when it comes to God. Likely many of us have not. Most find
                    themselves following what ever man made religion by default. By default meaning, whatever you were
                    exposed to as a child is typically the path you follow. Therefore, out of routine habit a person will
                    partake or participate in the traditions and rules of that religion’s practices. Thus mistaking this
                    as being in a relationship with God.</p>

                <p>Now being religious can be a stepping stone to recognizing moral authority and the perception of how
                    we are to live life in some aspects. It will likely bring a person to see God’s relevance, to
                    acknowledgment and belief. This mindset usually promotes attending church, singing in the choir and
                    maybe even a weekly bible study. But here is the danger and downfall of religion. By doing so it
                    makes us feel good about ourselves and in some cases that we are better than others who are not
                    doing these things. That God must really like us because we are checking the boxes. That one’s
                    effort or doing what is right somehow earns you salvation and redemption with God. Nothing could be
                    further from the truth. <span class="bold">Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:4-7</span></p>

                <p>The fact is clear none of those things actually place us in right relationship with God. That God is
                    seeking something from you as believers that is not tangible. In other words, not the things that
                    can be easily seen? That there simply is no works we can accomplish for salvation. That actually God
                    desires to be in an intimate, beyond brick and mortar relationship with you. Rather than that of a
                    religious acquaintance. Which is how a large majority of church folk treat one another.</p>

                <p>Instead, God wants to spend time with you. He wants to be involved in those matters behind your smile
                    and nice weekly Sunday clothes. He wants you to understand he knows all about you, even the things
                    you can’t recognize about yourself. He wants you in His word (Bible) and in prayer before Him. Not
                    because you always want something, but to establish and root those intangibles that can only come by
                    way of intimate Holy Spirit connection. You see anytime you are in a close relationship then there
                    is a constant need and dependency that manifest itself. Because of a profound love you can’t imagine
                    going a day without the other person. Well guess what? God desires this same reciprocal
                    relationship, one where both you and He are eternally invested in one another daily. Where you
                    believe in His Son, Jesus Christ. Where you truly trust Him to lead and you wholeheartedly follow.
                    Knowing through faith that He and He alone, not your religion or works. Is absolutely the only way
                    to salvation and a redemptive relationship with God the Father. <span class="bold">John 14:15-21</span></p>
