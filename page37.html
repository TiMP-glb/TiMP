                <p>Hello TiMP Nation! We are back after a week of pause to wrap up our “Glory in the Cross” study. I'm
                    sure most of you may have been taken aback by our title versus the direction our study has taken us.
                    However, that was exactly the point, we as believers must become more aware. We must not just follow
                    everything we see and hear but measure everything against God’s word. This not only brings truth to
                    light in our lives, but helps us clearly understand God’s intent and standards on how we are to
                    live. <span class="bold">Ephesians 1:17</span> " That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
                    of glory, may give unto you
                    the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him". Therefore when it comes to the cross
                    and how we have been falsely trained to elevate it versus the reality that we should not have, hold,
                    carve or erect any images of such. When you seek to study history and where things come from in our
                    practices, particularly as Christian believers you will be shocked! Further more most things are in
                    plan sight and known but being avoided in most churches. The question then becomes, Why is that?</p>

                <p>Again when we reference our study text in <span class="bold">Galatians 6:11-15</span>, Paul's goal
                    was that believers would
                    only look to what Jesus did and accomplished on the cross to be glorified not some graven, pagan
                    rooted man made image. If you study early cross depictions of Yehoshua/Yeshua (Jesus’s actual Hebrew
                    name which means the Lord is Salvation. In Greek the related spelling is Iesous (Ἰησοῦς), which then
                    in Latin becomes IESVS/Iesus, which in English is spelled Jesus. You will find Jesus alive and in
                    vigorous perfect health hanging on various cross depictions. This would be the total opposite of
                    Paul stressing and preaching Christ crucified. What happened to our Lord and Salvation leading up to
                    and hanging or that stick or cross which ever you prefer was gruesome and horrific! That was the
                    purpose of the physical cross to display shame, ridicule and death. But the purpose of Jesus!,
                    Hallelujah! was far greater!</p>

                <p>The cross is a very touchy and deep subject. Many will say, well they keep a cross as a reminder to
                    them of what Jesus did or that it brings them peace, or makes them feel safe. However, I’ve come to
                    recognize that if Jesus truly lives or dwells in us, then what need do we have for a cross as a
                    symbol or trinket? Many will say well I wear a cross to show the world may belief, faith and
                    acknowledgement of God and Jesus. This all sounds great. Yet some of these same folks never pick of
                    the Bible. And even some that do and should be the gatekeepers swing the door wide open for any kind
                    of manipulation and deception for followers and dollars. <span class="bold">Read 2 Corinthians
                        2:1-15.</span></p>

                <p>Yet, pay attention to what Jesus tells us to keep if we truly love Him and it's not a cross! In <span
                        class="bold">John
                        14:23</span>, Jesus in response to Judas (not Judas the betrayer) but another disciple with the
                    same name,
                    says "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him
                    and make our home with him. So, Jesus says keep his WORD!, not only that be He and the Father will
                    live in you!</p>

                <p>This was and is the danger of the cross being this idol piece for worship or dependency. What we
                    think are spiritual things we should not make images of them for the danger it may lead to worship
                    and idolatry. Which again is why God speaks against it in <span class="bold">Exodus 20:4-6</span>
                    and <span class="bold">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</span> as
                    we read in part 2 of this series. Lastly, as promised I want to leave you with the history and
                    origin of the cross. One source is from Vine’s Expository Dictionary which I’m sure is used by most
                    preachers and teachers of the word. Which brings a lot into question about the church and it’s
                    avoidance of the cross topic. </p>

                <p>Vine’s states: <span class="bold">Cross, Crucify</span>
                    <span class="bold">A — 1: σταυρός</span>

                    (<span class="bold">Strong's #4716</span> — Noun Masculine — stauros — stow-ros' )

                    denotes, primarily, "an upright pale or stake." On such malefactors were nailed for execution. Both
                    the noun and the verb stauroo, "to fasten to a stake or pale," are originally to be distinguished
                    from the ecclesiastical form of a two beamed "cross." The shape of the latter had its origin in
                    ancient Chaldea, and was used as the symbol of the god Tammuz (being in the shape of the mystic Tau,
                    the initial of his name) in that country and in adjacent lands, including Egypt. By the middle of
                    the 3rd cent. A.D. the churches had either departed from, or had travestied, certain doctrines of
                    the Christian faith. In order to increase the prestige of the apostate ecclesiastical system pagans
                    were received into the churches apart from regeneration by faith, and were permitted largely to
                    retain their pagan signs and symbols. Hence the Tau or T, in its most frequent form, with the
                    cross-piece lowered, was adopted to stand for the "cross" of Christ.

                    As for the Chi, or X, which Constantine declared he had seen in a vision leading him to champion the
                    Christian faith, that letter was the initial of the word "Christ" and had nothing to do with "the
                    Cross" (for xulon, "a timber beam, a tree," as used for the stauros, see under TREE).</p>

                <p>WOW! So all these years here is Vine’s clearly telling us that the origin of the cross as we know it
                    is rooted and created from man’s pagan worship NOT from GOD! Second is just a couple of insightful
                    video links I came across that take you through the history and origin. I strongly suggest you
                    watch. The second is the more detailed of the two. </p>

                <p>Well, I hope you review the video and seek God for wisdom regarding the cross. However, make no
                    mistake the evidence in His word is pretty clear. As the one gentleman in the video notes. If Christ
                    Jesus had died by noose or guillotine, I would even add a gun. Would we be wearing those or placing
                    them in our homes or in and on churches as a symbol of our belief and faith? I think not. Then why
                    are we doing so with the cross? Because truly there is no glory to Christ in doing that.</p>
