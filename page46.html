                <p>Hello and Happy Sunday TiMP Nation: </p>

                <p>Our next study after a couple weeks away will be focused on the book of Hebrews. In Hebrews we find
                    the author which is unknow as of today although many speculate whom it may be from Silas, Apollos,
                    Luke to Phillip. However, I believe we can pretty much rule out Paul as he received his confirmation
                    of Christ directly from Christ himself. The author of Hebrews received his from others (meaning
                    being told about Christ and the gospel indirectly) as noted in <span class="bold">Hebrews
                        2:3</span>, which is why I draw this
                    conclusion.</p>

                <p>As we open the passage, which as I’ve studied, is noted that if read in Hebrew it’s more like a
                    sermon. You immediately see the writer is strongly and purposefully speaking to the superiority of
                    Jesus Christ. As we go along in this study over the next few weeks, we will touch on 3 key elements
                    within the book of Hebrews.</p>

                <p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Christ Above All (His Superiority)</li>
                    <li>Warnings to not turn from the Truth</li>
                    <li> Theological Balance (How the writer uses OT scripture to as reference to today) and example
                        would be how Hebrews 8:1-10 and 10:18 is theologically balanced to <span class="bold">Jeremiah
                            31:31-34</span></li>
                    <li>Faithfulness</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>First, the Superiority of Jesus Christ in <span class="bold">Hebrew Chapters 1 – 2</span>, here we
                    find the writer going right
                    in so we know the established sovereignty of Christ. Starting in <span class="bold">Hebrews Chapter
                        1:1-4</span> this portion
                    of the context starts by making reference to the past and how God used to speak to his people
                    through the prophets. However, in these last days God now speaks to us by His Son (Jesus Christ the
                    Messiah). This is establishing that since Christ came to the earthly world, we have been living in
                    the last times awaiting His return. Christ is the fulfillment of the Messianic prophesies, we can
                    refer to <span class="bold">Numbers 24:14, Jeremiah 33:14-16</span> and just a couple of scripture
                    references. This also
                    speaks to what I like to call the Theological Balance. The other thing verses 1-2 support is <span
                        class="bold">Christ
                        being the ONLY source</span> for a sinner to re-establish a relationship with God The Father,
                    John 14:6
                    supports this. I use the word re-establish here as man (Adam) once has a relationship with God
                    before the fall (mankind sins), this is supported in <span class="bold">Genesis chapters 1-2.</span>
                </p>

                <p>The writer then writes in such a way to give an all-encompassing view of the completeness of Christ
                    sovereignty, that He is the heir of all things, that through Christ the world was made. Furthermore,
                    that Christ is the brightness of God’s glory and the express image of His person (if you want to see
                    God, you can see Him only through Christ Jesus). Christ upholds all things by the word of His power,
                    He alone purged (removed) our sins, His place is at the right hand of God The Father, His position
                    higher than the angels and by inheritance His name is above every name even that of the angels. Wow,
                    I want you to truly take in the fullness that God has bestowed upon our Lord and Savior. This
                    relates to John’s expression and validation in <span class="bold">John 1:1-5</span> and <span
                        class="bold"> John 1:1-10</span> as this is what the
                    disciples had heard, seen and touched and also had fellowship with the incarnate Christ (I am
                    referring here to Jesus being in human form).</p>

                <p>This is a good place to stop here in prep for our continuation on Christ Above All portion of study.
                    I would ask that you please take time and read the scriptures of reference in this weeks’ teaching
                    as they are important in establishing our study foundation going forward. God Bless and I will speak
                    with you all next week!</p>
