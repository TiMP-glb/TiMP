                <p>Hello TiMP Nation we are back with our new series “Already Been Defined”. Have you been paying
                    attention to our world in recent years? Society is increasingly pushing the envelope on setting its
                    own rules or opinions on what is or is not acceptable. One of the major areas we see this occurring
                    is in the “so called” redefining of the sexes or genders. No longer is it simply man and woman as
                    has already been defined by God, which is our series study text <span class="bold">Genesis
                        1:27-28</span>. People have shunned
                    God’s truth for their own personal preferences and pursuits. So what does it mean to redefine
                    something? The Cambridge Dictionary says this: to change the meaning of something or to make people
                    think about something in a new or different way.</p>

                <p>Let’s apply this definition to the vast amount of new words we hear used by today’s lost, defiant and
                    sinful world. Such as transgender, this is where a person expresses they no longer agree with their
                    God given identity at birth as male or female. Therefore, they try and redefine themselves as a man
                    who tries to identify as female and female who tries to identify as male. Then there is transexual,
                    where a person tries through medical assistance, such as reassignment therapy or hormone treatment
                    to physically change their body from being the sex they were given by God (born with). Then there is
                    non-binary, genderqueer, cross-dressers, drag queens, drag kings, homosexual (gay or lesbian),
                    bisexual, asexual, or some may decline to label their sexual orientation. There is even a group
                    defined as intersex. Finally if you didn’t know, they have redefined us regular folks who identify
                    with who God made us at birth, male or female as cisgender. Oh and for good measure if you like the
                    opposite sex as God intended you are a heterosexual. There are a lot more sinful redefinitions out
                    there too many to put into one writing for certain.</p>

                <p>I was truly stunned, yet not surprised in researching for this series, at the many avenues the world
                    is taking to try and get around God and His truth. I was left with a distinct thought. I recall the
                    saying that it takes so much less effort to smile and be happy then it does to be mean and hateful.
                    Over time this has been medically proven that it takes less facial muscles to smile than to frown.
                    My thought was look at all the work, effort and pains people are going through to redefine something
                    God made so simple and easy to understand from the very beginning of His creation. <span
                        class="bold">Genesis 1:27-28</span>
                    says, “So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female
                    he created them. God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the
                    earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living
                    creature that moves on the ground.”</p>

                <p>Notice how God not only defines proper identity roles as male and female but clearly places their
                    relationship (togetherness) and relations (sex) as the only way to be fruitful (produce children)
                    and increase in number (grow the population). <span class="bold">Genesis 2:24-25</span> is the connection scripture as God
                    let’s us know this should be done within marriage which commits the man and woman as one unit. I
                    believe what we may often miss when reading these portions of scripture is these are clear
                    definitions of spiritual fundamentals in step with God. Which is why He gives His blessing over it.
                    This is also the proper engagement between man and woman so there is no shame in it. By definition
                    this means there can be no painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the consciousness of
                    wrong or foolish behavior. Because God’s way is designed so that He can take part and be the head of
                    the oneness relationship. None of which can be applied or accomplished if having sex outside of
                    marriage or through the world’s sinful attempt to redefine the sexes, gender identity or marriage as
                    these endeavors go against God. Thus anytime we are going against God’s rules, standards and Truth
                    (Jesus) we should be ashamed!</p>

                <p>In Part 2 we will look at the mass push for the opposite of God’s definition to be normalized.</p>
