                <p>It's Sunday morning, hello and blessings to you all. In the initial parts of our series we discussed
                    how the present church culture as a whole is failing in reverent fear, honor and respect due unto
                    God. Our base text was taken from <span class="bold">Isaiah 29:16</span> which looked at the blind
                    disobedience of Israel and
                    how God viewed their heart. We touched on the backward mindset in approaching the Lord’s gospel. How
                    this creates enormous struggle for true spiritual growth and connection with God’s standards for
                    worshiping Him. Thus spilling over into the gospel which is presented far from the sustaining source
                    it was intended to be. The hope is that this teaching opens your eyes and your heart to paying more
                    attention to how you interact with God. Even more important how you represent the things concerning
                    Him, if you are a believer. I am reminded when reading our base text in Isaiah from a practical
                    sense that everything that looks good and well-intended may be falling short. That is to say that
                    many will tell you from individuals to churches that Jesus in the center of their worship. But in
                    practical reality the approach towards His presence and throne is more like anything goes which is a
                    major problem.</p>

                <p>Well, now that we’ve noticed the issues during this series, what good would it do us to stay there.
                    Like any well to do person we should look for a solution! One great example of how to properly
                    approach God is found in the study of the Tabernacle which was a highly restricted area built for
                    the Israelites where God’s presence dwelled <span class="bold">Exodus 25:8.</span> Maybe God will
                    have me do a teaching on
                    this down the road. However, the point here is this was a HOLY place designated by God to offer
                    sacrifices and only specific things and people were authorized to enter. The penalties for violating
                    the strict standards, principles and rules God had in place were severe <span class="bold">Leviticus
                        10:1-7.</span> </p>

                <p>Now some would argue, oh that was in the old days and we don’t need that type of reverence and
                    respect to enter before God today. It’s acceptable to come in the space we have designated for God
                    to gather with us and we do not need to make it all holy, holy. Because if we do then that will not
                    make it enjoyable for the people and attendance will suffer. Well then my friends the question you
                    have to ask yourself is what is the priority? If you recall from prior teachings God is the same God
                    yesterday, today and forever <span class="bold">Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 13:8.</span> Therefore, we can
                    know with certainty that
                    God’s expectation for entering into His presence has not changed. Plus remember, Jesus did not come
                    to abolish the law which the old testament prophets spoke of, but to fulfill it <span
                        class="bold">Matthew 5:17.</span> It is
                    simply by God’s grace that we are not punished immediately for our disrespect as people and nations
                    by God. </p>

                <p>Therefore, we should all the more desire and strive to please God by enacting the solutions He has
                    provided for us in His word. He gives us clear and specific directions on how we should approach and
                    present ourselves before His presence whether we are alone or gathering together. Remember if you
                    have accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and consider yourself in relationship under His
                    will and authority then these apply to you.</p>

                <p>Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit – 1 Corinthians 6:19</p>

                <p>It is a spiritual house, who’s spiritual sacrifices need to be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ
                    – 1 Peter 2:5</p>

                <p>When you enter into His gates and court it is to be done with thanksgiving, praise and to bless His
                    name – Psalms 100:4</p>

                <p>Which is your reasonable service unto God to present your body as a living sacrifice, holy and
                    acceptable – Romans 12:1</p>

                <p>To Spend time in intimate private prayer just you and God – Matthew 6:6
            </div>

            <p>Understanding all the while to submit and humble yourself as you come before God – James 4:5-8</p>

            <p>As with most actions we take, setting a good example, sets better potential for righteous living in those
                we are trying to reach. We desperately need to get back to doing things God’s way in the church because
                one day soon Jesus will return. We should hold ourselves and church leadership accountable for nothing
                less. There would be nothing greater to hear when this roller coaster journey of life is over. Than to
                hear Jesus say what He illustrated in the parable of talents “well done my good and faithful servant…”
                <span class="bold">Matthew 25:21.</span> </p>
