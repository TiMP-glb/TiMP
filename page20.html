                <p>Hello TiMP Nation and Happy Birthday to my God given blessing of a Mother who celebrated her 77th on
                    yesterday! God is truly gracious granting her 77 years of life and the majority of those spent in
                    service and worship unto Him. This thought takes us right into part 4 of our series “The Effective
                    Change of Jesus”. In Part 1 we covered John 1 verses 1 and 2 which speak to and confirm the deity of
                    Jesus Christ. Then in part 2, John 1 verse 3. We see John attest to the preincarnate work of Jesus
                    Christ. Preincarnate means Jesus existed before He was incarnate which is “in” the flesh as man.
                    Yes, I know hard to get your mind around how that works, well that just speaks to the awesomeness of
                    why Jesus is Lord. </p>

                <p>Let’s make it simple to understand, remember “in” the beginning Jesus was with God and then to
                    fulfill God’s will, He humbly came “in” the world to save/rescue us. Okay, now John 1 verses 4-5
                    continue this preincarnate picture of Jesus, “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
                    And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.” Life, what a blessing
                    it is to have one and contrary to popular belief we only get one. None of us will be coming back as
                    a tornado or your favorite pet. However, when John was writing about Jesus in this passage, he’s not
                    only speaking to Jesus being the creator of human life, but also of him being the only source of life
                    eternal for mankind. He then compliments this validation that a life in Christ is the light of men.
                </p>
                <p>Now why would anyone need a light? The only logical reason is, there must be darkness somewhere. So,
                    when we look closer at what John is conveying, he’s speaking to a relationship with Christ. More
                    specifically how this relationship will effectively breakthrough the darkness in your life. Jesus,
                    affirms this Himself in <span class="bold">John 8:12</span> and in <span class="bold">John
                        14:6</span> “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me
                    shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life”. “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no
                    man can come unto the Father, but by me.”</p>

                <p>Think of it this way most of us love being out and about during the day and most things are done
                    during the day. Why? Because we can see and being able to see reduces fear and a multitude of other
                    things. Even those who go out at night are comfortable doing so because lights function in buildings
                    and on the streets. Even our cars have headlights to guide us along the path we drive. Now, imagine
                    driving or walking in complete darkness without light anywhere. Unfortunately, many people live their lives
                    this way. This is why we have such a high rate of suicide around the world, due to spiritual and
                    mental conditions. Too often we find people or a family member saying they are or were in a dark
                    place after it’s too late. They become fearful of what lies ahead or overwhelmed by life’s
                    circumstances or situations. This is a tale tell sign that a relationship with Christ was either
                    non-existent or misunderstood which allows the darkness to prevail. However, a life with the light
                    of Jesus Christ on the inside of you defeats darkness no matter what form or shape it tries to come
                    in! The key is you must fully believe and understand who you are in relationship with. Then darkness
                    can’t prevail over you because it can’t even comprehend the Light who is living on the inside! Remember, this
                    is exactly what the disciples had to learn on the boat. </p>

                <p>In closing our series, the solution is not ending life or taking it for granted, the solution is the
                    effect Jesus Christ can have on it. Jesus is the Light because He is the substantive moral reality
                    of biblical truth, purity, holiness and righteousness. The darkness represents the sin and wrong we
                    perpetrate before God and the broken relationship we had or still have with Him if we have not come
                    to repentance. But you see, Jesus!, is the remedy for all that troubles you. Jesus is the guiding
                    light for all your dark days and nights, Jesus is the only one that can remedy your relationship
                    with God the Father. Jesus is the only one that can irrevocably change your life, because He is
                    the only one that knows all about you from beginning to end. </p>
