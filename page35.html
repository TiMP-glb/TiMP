                <p>Hello TiMP Nation and I wish you all a Happy Resurrection Day!</p>

                <p>This week is a brief intermission from our “Glory in the Cross” teaching. Next week we will continue
                    that series and trust me the truth that you will learn, you don’t want to miss it! Galatians 6:11-15</p>

                <p>However, today take joy in celebration of our risen Savior, Jesus Christ. This really should be of
                    daily remembrance and humbled excitement as we are undeserving. We should not be teaching each other
                    or our children about bunnies, eggs or chocolates. None of that is biblical. Rather we should teach
                    what is true and proper before God and that is Jesus. Because thankfully no bunny rabbit, eggs or
                    chocolate can save any of us. It is only by faith, if you confess with your mouth and believe in
                    your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord and was raised from the dead. That is the absolute condition
                    for salvation. I am more than thankful today to be saved as a flawed man by His self-less sacrifice
                    and the loving will of God the Father.</p>

                <p>Below is the biblical context from Paul to the Romans that Salvation is available to everyone: <span class="bold">Romans‬ ‭10:5-13‬ ‭NLT</span>‬‬</p>

                <p>“For Moses writes that the law’s way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of
                    its commands. But faith’s way of getting right with God says, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will go
                    up to heaven?’ (to bring Christ down to earth). And don’t say, ‘Who will go down to the place of the
                    dead?’ (to bring Christ back to life again).” In fact, it says, “The message is very close at hand;
                    it is on your lips and in your heart.” And that message is the very message about faith that we
                    preach: If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from
                    the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God,
                    and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, “Anyone who
                    trusts in him will never be disgraced.” Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect. They have the
                    same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him. For “Everyone who calls on the name of the
                    Lord will be saved.”</p>

                <p>My hope on this day is for those who have yet to come to this expression of faith and confession of
                    belief. My prayer is you will simply take a moment to search your heart and give Christ and
                    opportunity to come in to experience His life changing love.</p>
