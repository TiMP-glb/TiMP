                <p>In this present time with the latest pandemic we are forced to make adjustments in how
                    we approach day to day activities. With the direction to wear mask and social distance
                    we are creating what is being called a “new normal”.</p>

                    <p>This crisis along with those before it so often reveal people and their true motives.
                    This should not be a surprise as this is a normal part of the world we have cultivated.
                    Protests in the streets under the agenda that one’s rights are being violated by stay at
                    home orders. Then you see folks show up with guns, anger and hate filled speech. How is
                    this approach a remedy for safety and the hope of preventing future lives from being
                    lost? Even some in church leadership chose this time as an opportunity for
                    self-promotion, rather than obedience. Under the falsehood of “faith” church leaders
                    disobeyed direct orders from those in authority over state government. Let’s be clear
                    disobedience and faith do not work together. It seems for some the collection plate may
                    be a stronger motivation, than the reverent following of God’s word. There in this
                    present-day madness is the premise behind it all, self and money. Paul in his second
                    inspired letter to Timothy talks specifically about this type of mentality in the last
                    days. <span class="bold">Read in its entirety 2 Timothy Chapter 3.</span></p>

                    <p>Often times we hear God’s word whether in church, on the radio, through a friend or
                    family member. Some may even hear it from a stranger and if your fortunate enough
                    through the Holy Spirit. If you reflect for just a second there is no escaping God’s
                    word. Now granted God’s word has a different effect depending on your heart and
                    relationship with Christ. Some folks willing walk in obedience to authority of the Word,
                    while others seek to be their own authority. We are in the midst of situations that are
                    beyond our control, yet they are a purposeful part of God’s designed plan for His
                    return.</p>

                    <p>The reality is there is no such thing as a “new normal” it’s just the same normal we
                    always do; we just try and find different ways to “mask” how we go about our selfish
                    inner nature. You see the world should not be trying to get back to normal, quite the
                    opposite. The world should be seeking to do what is “abnormal” and that is to surrender
                    and follow Jesus. Very easy to fall in line with the status quo very hard to
                    purposefully be set apart. This is not the first nor will it be the last pandemic or
                    unknown battle we will face. This world at some point will come to an end, that is the
                    infallible certainty of God’s word. <span class="bold">Read 1 Peter 4:7</span></p>

            <!-- From Greg’s TiMP Garden:
                Our world today is all about being hurry. From ordering online, daily travel to something as simple as
                saying hello. The act patience has become a relic of stories told in ancient times. It's ironic God tells us
                that being patient benefits us greatly. However, he never mentions being in a hurry producing any
                lasting
                effective outcome. Proverbs 14:29 -->
