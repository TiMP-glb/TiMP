                <p>Good day TiMP Nation and as always Happy Sunday! I pray all had a blessed week and an opportunity to
                    start reading in the book of Hebrews. With that let’s get right to it.</p>

                <p>Last week started with point #1 Christ above all (His Superiority). Let’s continue there as we see
                    the writer in <span class="bold">Hebrews Chapter 1</span> notes in context that Christ is greater
                    than the angels’ starting at
                    verse 4. He also notes that the name of Jesus is above the angels because no angel has ever been
                    called son by God. Now at first glance you may say, why tell us this as we already know Jesus is
                    above the angels. Well yes, but as you read the remainder of chapter 1, you may not catch that there
                    are several distinct decrees being clearly established by God the Father Himself, as well as
                    solidifying the relationship between He and His Son. For our Theological Balance we can also refer
                    to the Old Testament scripture <span class="bold">Psalm 2:6-7</span></p>

                <p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li> Jesus Christ deity and position within the God-head (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). God makes it
                        plan that Jesus Christ is His only Son.</li>
                    <li>Christ in His deity is above the angels who are not in the God-Head (Trinity). The angels serve
                        a specific purpose as ministering spirits (messengers or servants) to those who will inherit
                        salvation <span class="bold">Hebrews 1:14.</span></li>
                    <li>The inheritance of salvation can only come through Jesus Christ. <span class="bold">Acts
                            4:12</span> along with <span class="bold">John 14:6</span> and
                        <span class="bold">Philippians 2:10-11</span> just to name a few establish our theological
                        balance here as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>That Jesus is just like His Father, He loves what is right and hates what is wrong.</li>
                    <li>That Jesus is truly the Son of God before the foundation of the world. <span
                            class="bold">Hebrews 1:10, John 1:1-2</span></li>
                    <li>Only Jesus Christ reign as King and Lord is never-ending (meaning eternal)</li>
                    <li>By inheritance His name is more excellent than any of the angels</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>All of the above speak to Jesus Christ in His elevated glory and deity as God (because He in every
                    way the exactness of His Father). However, in Chapter 1 there is a transition that takes place where
                    we see God The Father introduce space and time relative to Jesus. This is important as space and
                    time is only tied to human beings not God. Yet we see here that God in <span class="bold">Hebrews
                        1:5</span> says something he
                    has never said to the angels. He decrees that Jesus is His Son, but he distinctly notes “Today” I
                    have become your Father, and thus repeats, “I will be His Father and He will be my Son”, within the
                    same scripture verse.</p>

                <p>This may seem a bit like something from a real dramatic Shakespearean play, but I assure you this is
                    not the case! In fact, this pivot by God The Father in speaking about His only Begotten Son, is what
                    we all should be falling on our knees giving the utmost thanks and praise for! When God says “Today”
                    he is speaking to, acknowledging, decreeing and revealing His Son Jesus in human form to the world,
                    not by procreation (the way physical man and woman bring forth children) but by the might and power
                    of His awesome will! Remember, Christ in human form was born of a virgin by way of the Holy Spirit
                    upon God’s own creation woman (Mary). The seed of man was not involved in His human existence. See
                    <span class="bold">Isaiah 9:6, Luke 1:35, Galatians 4:4</span> for theological balance. Thus, the
                    writer continues to
                    establish the Superiority of Christ in several more ways as it relates to us human beings.

                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Jesus Christ the Son of God could take on human flesh.</li>
                    <li>Only Jesus Christ the Son of God could be both God and man at the same time. <span
                            class="bold">Colossians 2:9.</span>
                        This is called the <span class="bold"><i><u>Hypostatic Union</u></i></span></li>
                    <li>Only Jesus Christ could be sinless and obedient unto death (the laying down of His physical
                        life).
                        <span class="bold">Philippians 2:8</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Only Jesus Christ shed blood could reconcile the sins of man (for theological balance refer to
                        <span class="bold">Colossians 1:20, Ephesians 1:7, Leviticus 17:11</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Only Jesus has resurrection power to willing lay His life down and take it up again because He
                        received this command from His Father. <span class="bold">John 10:17</span></li>
                    <li>Only Jesus Christ could be the complete fulfillment of God’s plan for mankind’s salvation. See
                        <span class="bold">Isaiah 53:3-7</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Only Jesus could be anointed by God The Father more than anyone else. <span class="bold">Hebrews
                            1:9</span></li>
                    <li>Only Jesus Christ the Son of God, The Messiah, The Savior, The Living Word, The Alpha, The
                        Omega.
                        Only He sits on the throne at the right hand of God The Father.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>You see, only Jesus Christ is everlasting beyond this temporary world we live in. Lastly why is Jesus
                    Christ superior above all? Because God our Father said so! Amen!</p>

                <p>Stay tuned next week as we touch on point #2 and part 3 in our series “Hebrews”. The warning from
                    God not to neglect the salvation of Jesus Christ. Or more simply put not to reject His Son.</p>
