                <p>Happy Sunday all and hopefully you had time over the past two Sundays to read and ponder areas that
                    need insulation in your life. Which is where we will pick up part 2 of our series with <span
                        class="bold">Ephesians
                        6:10-18.</span> Now here we have Paul writing to the believer’s at Ephesus while in prison. He
                    is looking
                    at insulation through the lens of spiritual warfare we as believers in Christ will undergo. What Paul is
                    understanding and trying to convey to the people then and even us today through God’s word; is that we
                    must be prepared for the journey and battles of following and proclaiming the gospel. That having
                    the ability to insulate the other aspects of our life first start with putting on what he calls, the
                    whole armor of God.</p>

                <p>Now the way he breaks this down is divinely inspired and very much relatable. It reminds me of the old school folks
                    when I was a kid, who would say we are soldiers in the army of the Lord.  Well just think, what leader
                    anywhere in the world sends out their soldiers unprepared for the adversity they are going to face.
                    So, Paul says look, God is no different in this aspect has he provides us with the spiritual insulation we need to stand against and
                    be victorious over the enemy. First, he preps us to know where the threat is coming from in <span
                        class="bold">verse
                        12</span>, as he uses the term wrestle. If you have ever wrestled someone, then you understand
                    the
                    trickery and deception one uses to try and pin down or submit their opponent. But in this case the
                    opponent your facing is not a physical person but the spiritual evils and rulers of darkness. Now,
                    I don’t know about you, but I don’t think they sell the necessary insulation required for this type
                    of situation at Home Depot. </p>

                <p>The blessing is God has already prepared us, we just have to be willing to put it into use daily and
                    he lays it out for us in <span class="bold">verses 14-18.</span> First, we must Gird ourselves with
                    Truth. Girding refers to a
                    belt or band that a soldier would use to hold and secure a sword to his body. Then put on our
                    Breastplate of Righteousness. Breastplate refers to a device a soldier would wear to protect the
                    chest down to the waist from being injured. Then, you are to Shod your feet with the Preparedness of
                    the Gospel of Peace. Shod means to wear shoes and in Paul’s day Roman soldiers wore boots with nails
                    in them to grip the ground in combat. This would reflect us as believers standing firm knowing that
                    God’s word is faithful. Next to complete our insulation from the elements and to fully outfit
                    ourselves for battle, we need The Shield of Faith and the Helmet of Salvation. One of the greatest
                    tactics of the Roman soldiers and what made them so difficult to defeat was their shield and helmet.
                    When under attack they would insulate and protect themselves by uniformly huddling together and
                    utilizing their shields and helmets. This would be done in the form of a circle or square which ever
                    was most effective at the time. The outer soldiers would place their very large shields together and
                    the inner soldier would place there shields above their helmets. This created a highly impenetrable
                    covering and protected their whole body from the arrows and fiery darts of the enemy from all sides.
                    Which is exactly why God as instructed us to put it on! </p>

                <p>By putting on your Shield of Faith it shows trust that God’s word and promises are above all. This
                    helps insulate us through obedience and shields us from the temptations of all sorts of sin. The
                    helmet obviously protects our heads and keeps us from any doubtful thoughts, about the guaranteed assurance of salvation if you are
                    a believer. Lastly, the Sword of the Spirt. Think about a soldier during those times, the sword was
                    their only weapon. Thus, for us who are believer’s God’s word is our sword and only weapon needed.
                    It is far more powerful than anything you can do or that Satan has to defeat you. Therefore, no
                    matter what the battlefield may look like, stay in prayer, be watchful knowing that you can stand
                    and you will persevere. Remember God’s word is your best offense and defense when putting up
                    insulative protection for your life.</p>
