                <p>I noticed over the past two weeks as we have been in the throws of a national social injustice crisis.
                    The church I attend which is majority white has avoided talking about issues of racism, inequality,
                    police brutality and racial profiling. Issues which are important to my family and I as people of
                    color.
                    But how can they speak on something they don’t understand? Nor really put into action those things
                    that
                    could help them understand. I know this may not go over well as some of them are on this TiMP
                    distribution. However, real change does not come from rhetoric talk but from realized actionable
                    decisions outside your comfort zone.</p>

                <p>Drew Brees a famous, wealthy, prolific NFL quarterback became the poster child for what being out of
                    touch looks like. When asked a question about kneeling as it relates to the intended protest
                    regarding
                    the issues I just mentioned. He did exactly what most do when confronted with the opportunity to put
                    their talk into action. They avoid or change the subject to what is comfortable and self confident
                    for
                    them. So here is a supposed Christian man with a tremendous platform and his focused passion was on
                    a
                    flag. At best he should have spoken about the impact Christ can have if we were to all follow Him
                    instead of our own ideology.</p>

                <p>Listen, placing a flag or any other inanimate object of any sort to exaltation is a misplaced line
                    of
                    sight. Only God who is the beginning and end deserves to be exalted and worshipped. Yet most show
                    more
                    care and concern for Americas stars and stripes that will fade away, then they do for the maker of
                    the
                    stars and the stripes that paid the price for their sins.
                    The flag did not die for you or me Jesus did. A flag when raised to it’s highest point on a flag
                    pole is
                    still just a piece of cloth. But Jesus raised from the dead showed a living Savior. Who sits at the
                    highest place of authority at the right hand of God the Father.</p>

                <p>A flag may represent where you come from but it should never represent or take the place of who you
                    are.
                    It was never about a flag nor should it ever be about a flag it should be about the people. Your
                    hand
                    shouldn’t be over your heart to salute at piece of cloth your heart should be open to pour out to
                    those
                    around you. God did not command us to love a flag he commanded us to love one another.</p>
