                <p>I hope reading the 7 chapters did not seem much. The sneaky goal was to have you all read at least a
                    Bible chapter a day to form a good habit and thus we would complete Daniel. At any rate, feedback
                    from
                    most via the web blog or text has been to continue the series. Which joys my heart that you are
                    enjoying
                    the teaching lessons. I sincerely believe this opportunity to learn and grow together is about the
                    collective whole and God’s word abounding in our lives. Furthermore, my goal is always to put God
                    first.
                    In doing so, I hope to reach that one person or persons who have yet to call Jesus their Lord and
                    Savior. With that we will extend the series ‘’Recognizing the Lion is not King” and conclude with
                    part
                    6.</p>

                <p>Ok so let’s pick up where we left off last week. The Hebrew boys Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah are
                    covered by Jesus in His pre-incarnate (before human flesh) form from the fire. We see the
                    awesomeness of
                    our Lord as that is His goal with us today, to save us from the eternal fire. Thankfully none of us
                    have
                    to go into an oversized pizza oven to experience His grace and loving salvation. After the
                    experience
                    the boys are promoted within the kingdom. As noted, Nebuchadnezzar after living like an animal
                    finally
                    gives up all praise and glory to God. Funny, had Nebuchadnezzar learned from what the Lord told to
                    Jeremiah he could have saved himself a lot of trouble. <span class="bold">Read Jeremiah
                        9:23-24.</span></p>

                <p>As God is true to his word at some point around 563 B.C. (before Christ), Nebuchadnezzar dies and a
                    new
                    King is over Babylon. We know these folks today as Chaldeans. A little history nugget, the
                    <span class="bold">B.C./A.D.</span>
                    system is from the ninth century it was adopted by Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne for dating acts of
                    government throughout Europe. The A.D. however is confusing as its Latin for “anno domini” (“in the
                    year
                    of the Lord”) not “after death” as most people think. As I understand it was to represent the year
                    Jesus
                    was born to of course become flesh (incarnate). The new king Belshazzar is now in power over Babylon
                    the
                    events of his reign are roughly 20 years after Nebuchadnezzar’s death around 539 B.C. The most
                    notable
                    event that occurs is the night of a great feast for a thousand of his lords. It was his way of
                    trying to
                    boost morale because they way under impending takeover by the Medo-Persian army led by Darius the
                    Mede
                    (King Cyrus). At some point during the feast they were getting drunk and praising their gods of
                    gold,
                    silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone. Remember the vessels they are drinking from for this feast
                    belong
                    to the temple of God. Nebuchadnezzar who is actually Belshazzar’s grandfather had taken them when he
                    conquered Jerusalem earlier in chapter 1. <span class="bold">Read Daniel 1:1-2.</span> If your
                    reading the bible it says father
                    but it was actually interchangeable with grandfather. Which just like his grandfather before him the
                    use
                    of the vessels is their way of challenging God. However, on this night God’s answer to the king
                    challenging his authority was swift. Just like in life today sometimes the writing is on the wall
                    and we
                    need to heed to it.</p>

                <p>God supernaturally writes “MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN” on the plaster wall where they were feasting.
                    Read <span class="bold">Daniel 6:25-28.</span> This clearly frightened the King but the queen had an
                    answer and it was of course
                    Daniel. For clarity the queen is not the wife of Belshazzar. History notes she is either the wife or
                    daughter of Nebuchadnezzar or the wife of Belshazzar’s dad Nabonidus (Nebuchadnezzar’s son) who was
                    co-ruler of the kingdom. He’s mentioned without name in chapter 5 verse 16. Belshazzar offers Daniel
                    to
                    become the third ruler of the kingdom if he interprets for him the writing. Daniel refuses his
                    offerings
                    and tells him the meaning of the writing. It’s amazing how you read this and you see the arrogance
                    of
                    the king even after knowing the humbling his grandfather had experienced at the hand of God prior.
                    However, once Daniel was done the king commanded Daniel be clothed in purple and a gold chain placed
                    around his neck to be third ruler of the kingdom. That however was short lived as that very night
                    Belshazzar is killed.</p>

                <p>Lastly, for this week I want you to note the old testament to the new testament correlation. The
                    color
                    purple symbolically represented royalty, majesty and high officials, also luxury, wealth etc… The
                    fact
                    and mockery of Daniel being clothed in a purple garment and gold chain should not go unnoticed. It
                    actually foreshadows the mockery that will happen to the real King of Kings sometime later. Except
                    Jesus
                    had a purple garment and a crown of thorns placed on his head. <span class="bold">Read John
                        19:1-3.</span></p>

            <!-- From Greg’s TiMP Garden:
                Our world today is all about being hurry. From ordering online, daily travel to something as simple as
                saying hello. The act patience has become a relic of stories told in ancient times. It's ironic God tells us
                that being patient benefits us greatly. However, he never mentions being in a hurry producing any
                lasting
                effective outcome. Proverbs 14:29 -->
