                <p>Hello TiMP Nation we are back with another inward perspective moment and teaching from the word of
                    the Lord. Our study will use as scriptural foundation <span class="bold">1 Corinthians 14:33</span> “For God is not the author
                    of confusion but of peace”. This new series will take us into the topic of “confusion”. In
                    particular how it’s used to promote and perpetuate an immoral mindset and related actions that are
                    contrary to God’s truth in the church and the world. Confusion by definition is the lack of
                    understanding and/or uncertainty. In the Greek new testament language, the word <span class="bold">akatastasia</span> meaning
                    “instability” translates to confusion.
                    To begin we must first understand the context of <span class="bold">1 Corinthians 14:33.</span> Also you may have noticed I
                    excluded the portion of the verse that says “as in all the churches of the saints”. Technically this
                    portion actually belongs at the beginning of verse 34 thus verse 33 would be a stand-alone
                    statement. In the overall context of <span class="bold">chapter 14,</span> we find Paul who has been dealing with the church
                    at Corinth on their issue of lovelessness. Now as you can imagine this issue if not corrected,
                    creates confusion and impacts the truth and effectiveness of the gospel. Paul has been trying to get
                    them to function as a unified congregation and to pursue godly love. Not just for one another but
                    with particular diligence and determination for the things of God. As the church did have presence
                    of spiritual gifts and right doctrine was in place, we can see this starting in <span class="bold">chapter 12</span> and most
                    notably <span class="bold">chapter 13</span> you can read these for reference. Here in <span class="bold">chapter 14</span> the discussion centers
                    around desiring spiritual gifts in particular prophecy and tongues. Paul was cautioning that
                    obtaining or use of these gifts should not be for personal adoration but to edify the church. </p>

                <p>Paul in this particular passage focuses his teaching on prophecy and tongues, that tongues must be
                    interpreted, that tongues is a sign to unbelievers. In the latter portion he addresses the topic of
                    order in church meetings. The reason being just like today there were carnal minded counterfeit
                    Christians in Corinth. God’s word in <span class="bold">Romans 8:7</span> says “the carnal
                    mind is enmity (opposed/hostile)
                    against God, and is not subject to God’s law neither indeed can be”. Now from <span
                        class="bold">chapter 14</span> you can
                    pull out a few things that are confusing and controversial in the modern church today. The one we
                    will focus on in the first part of this series is speaking in tongues. I’m sure at some point in
                    time whether in church or on television you have experienced someone shouting, hands flailing, and
                    with a passionate performance, uttering something like
                    “boom-shaka-laka-bam-bam-tee-tee-e-i-e-i-uh-oh”! With a hallelujah or thank you Jesus on the end.
                </p>

                <p>In a lot of churches today these indescribable utterances amongst the church faithful are considered
                    a marker in determining if you are truly saved, sanctified or in some cases a believer in Jesus
                    Christ. Confused yet? Well, you should be. And that’s exactly the position these folks that pray on
                    your confusion want you to be in. Now I’m sure there are some folks who follow the speaking in
                    tongues ritual because they simply are followers or honestly don’t understand the word to know any
                    better. I’m reminded of a quote by the famous journalist Edward R. Murrow that says, “anyone who
                    isn’t confused really doesn’t understand the situation”. If you are some place or in a church and
                    you think this type of display is of God, Run! Because it is not! Understand the situation you are
                    in, this is pagan ecstatic <span class="bold">Ungodly Gibberish</span> and edification of
                    one’s self. If we look back to our
                    premise, God is not the author of confusion. Here is what God’s word says when it comes to those who
                    do this. In <span class="bold">verse 2 of chapter 14</span> Paul teaches that “For he who
                    speaks in a tongue does not speak to
                    men but to god (a god), for no one understands him and in the spirit he speaks mysteries”. In your
                    bible you may see God capitalized and assume Paul is referring to Jehovah God. However, that would
                    be incorrect as most of the new testament was translated from Greek which normally did not contain
                    definite articles. Thus, it should be lower case as I indicate. This and the concluding wording of
                    the verse “in the spirit he speaks mysteries” would support this fact. As we know there are no
                    mysteries to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>

                <p>Ok so let me break this down a bit further. There were some within the church at Corinth just like
                    today that were not interested in being understood but making a dramatic display to the public or
                    the congregation. Think, Paula White, T.D. Jakes, Joyce Meyers, even Madea, Tyler Perry himself
                    among others get in on this falsehood (you can YouTube the clown show with him and T.D Jakes). They
                    then manipulated the word to confuse people into thinking that tongues are some great gift that only
                    a few are privileged with and understand it. None the less this display of antics from these false
                    teaching and false doctrine spreading folks is not of the Holy Spirit but of their own human spirit
                    or demonic. I’m going to be brutally honest here for all intents and purposes most that participate
                    in this farce do it as a learned or pressured behavior. The leaders that promote it are ear and
                    visual hustlers keen on the fact the most will fall for this because they take scripture and teach
                    confusion that sounds true to justify their immoral and unrighteous actions.</p>

                <p>This is why as I always say it’s vital that you seek the Lord, read and study his word for yourself.
                    Paul goes on to clarify that this gibberish tongue you hear is false by comparing it to musical
                    instruments, <span class="bold">read verses 8-9.</span> He basically says “even things
                    without life like instruments make a
                    sound we can understand, if they don’t then how would we know the songs or instruments”. He then
                    simply notes the same should be for the tongue, “if words are not spoken that people easily
                    understand then how can we know what is being said? If not, then we are simply speaking into air”.
                    Today that statement would be translated to the expression of one who mumbles saying nothing or
                    blowing hot air. This is exactly what the church at Corinth and a large majority of modern churches
                    pushing this false speaking in tongues doctrine are doing.</p>

                <p>Oh, but there is good news to be found in God’s word to put an end to the confusion on speaking in
                    tongues and to clarify what genuine spiritual gifted tongues from God was at that time. And how it
                    doesn’t exist or is needed today. If you desire to learn and see the truth come back next Sunday for
                    part 2 and conclusion to the tongues portion of our journey into, Are You Confused?</p>
