                <p>Hello TiMP Nation. I hope you are having a blessed and safe Sunday. I hope you enjoyed the “Are You
                    Confused” Speaking in Tongues series. God willing, we will continue that series with a different
                    topic needing clarity in the near future. But for this week we will redirect our attention. We are
                    all aware of the tremendous tragedies of violence occurring all around the world. We are also still
                    in the storm of an epic pandemic. Plus, the work of the enemy is in constant search mode. Yet as we
                    prepare for another Resurrection Sunday in the coming week. My heart was reminded we should all the
                    look to the Glory in the Cross!</p>

                <p>Our teaching text for this week is found in <span class="bold">Galatians 6:11-15</span> where Paul in
                    his closing letter to the
                    Galatians writes on this topic. Just a brief context around the book of Galatians. We likely think
                    of the Galatians as a single church. However, it gets its name from Galatia a region of Asia Minor
                    which today is Turkey and was made up of different cities. Thus, there were multiple churches in
                    Galatia and Paul is addressing them all in this letter. He is particularly concerned about the old
                    Jewish way of thinking. That one must meet or satisfy the expectations from the Old Testament Torah.
                    One must fulfill the law (commandments), men must be circumcised, one must obey the sabbath and eat
                    kosher (this is basically food that met the Jewish dietary custom). However, at the time of his
                    writing Christianity had spread tremendously outside of Israel and thus many non-Jewish people were
                    followers of the faith. However, traditional Jewish Christians who migrated to Galatia were
                    basically causing conflict with the gospel of Jesus that had been established. Paul finds himself
                    throughout chapters 1-5 addressing various topics, from defending the gospel, addressing the purpose
                    of the law and that love fulfills the law. But in chapter 6 which is our focus he concludes his
                    letter with why we should look to the cross.</p>

                <p>One of the main things you recognize when reading this text starting at <span class="bold">verse
                        11</span> is that Paul is
                    specific in telling the churches he wrote this in his own hand. Also, that it was written in very
                    large letters. I gather this was to stress the importance of the message he was trying to convey to
                    the traditional Jewish Christians. Then in <span class="bold">verse 12</span> he goes right at the
                    Judaizers prideful
                    intentions. Their whole goal with adhering to the law and circumcision and the Messianic customs
                    were to please their flesh. Even so, not to upset the normal discourse so they could maintain their
                    financial and social status. Paul knew they were without a doubt more concerned for their personal
                    well-being and public opinion, than allowing themselves to be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
                    <span class="bold">Verse 13</span> he goes on to say even those who are so called keepers of the
                    law, don’t keep the law. Yet,
                    they would actively work to convert Gentiles to the law just so they could boast and brag to receive
                    glory from men. Paul then in <span class="bold">verse 14</span> clearly notes that he nor any of us
                    have a right to boast or
                    brag about anything unless we are boasting and bragging about the sacrifice Jesus made for us on the
                    cross. He then says, it is by Christ that the world has been crucified to him and he to the world.
                    <span class="bold">Romans 6:10-11</span> explains this best, Jesus died once to break the power of
                    sin and through His
                    resurrection not only does He live but it’s for the glory of God. So, if you are a born-again
                    believer in Christ Jesus you should be dead to the powers of this sinful world and alive to God
                    through Christ Jesus.
                </p>

                <p>Paul then closes out this text in <span class="bold">verse 15</span> by saying it really doesn’t matter whether you are circumcised
                    (Jewish traditionalist) or uncircumcised (Gentile). To break this down a bit further, God did not
                    intend for the redemption of salvation to only be for Israel. God from the very beginning intended
                    this gift at the cross for all who believe no matter your culture or ethnic background (<span
                        class="bold">John 3:16</span>).
                    If you have not believed and understood the sacrifice and eternal life offered at the cross; to
                    become a new creation before God the Father through Christ Jesus; then nothing you do will amount to
                    anything. I will leave you all this week with my visual depiction of how I see the Glory in the
                    Cross of Jesus. The top or head of the cross points to the heavens for its source is God. The horizontal
                    flank on the cross stretches wide just like God’s love. The cross points in all directions,
                    signifying to every corner of the earth that Jesus Christ is Lord. The cross is a perfect picture of
                    Jesus Christ who is the Father’s glory. </p>

                <p>There was a song I grew up hearing as a child and I still recall to this day. “At the cross, at the
                    cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of me heart rolled away. It was there by faith I
                    received my sight and now I am happy all the day”. We must recognize that the cross is not the end, 
                    but only the beginning. That although we hold what happened on the cross in highest regard as it is 
                    fundamental to our faith as believers. Our desire should be beyond the cross for the cross itself is nothing. Our desire should be
                    on those things above (<span class="bold">Read Colossians 3:1-4</span>). Our desire should be eternal life through Jesus
                    Christ which His love and sacrifice at the cross affords us the opportunity, because at the cross there was Victory! Glory be
                    to God!</p>
