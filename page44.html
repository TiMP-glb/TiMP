                <p>Happy New Year and God’s grace and blessings to you all TiMP Nation, we are back! I know many of you
                    were wondering about the past few months and the hiatus, I took from teaching. As in speaking with
                    some of you it was simply a momentary step back. Not from reading, studying or seeking God’s wisdom.
                    But recognizing we had a lot going on in the Burris household having young children and various
                    schedules for all things we need to attend to. Thus at times my study and research time is impacted
                    and for me personally as I’ve always noted, I have no desire to short God in teaching His word or to
                    appease the public in putting out something I know is not directed by the Holy Spirit.</p>

                <p>However, God is faithful and here we are back with a renewed purpose for 2022!
                    I don’t know about you, but I’m always reverently fearful, but excited about what God’s plan is to
                    have His real truth known and taught. I pray for all of us who are with humble hearts, sincere
                    approach and seeking wisdom to tell the never failing truth of God’s word.</p>

                <p>Now when we last spoke in August 2021 we were on the subject of “Already Defined” in discussing the
                    lie the world is telling in an attempt to normalize homosexuality and perverse attitudes towards the
                    roles of men and women. We will definitely come back to that as it’s imperative to do so. So please
                    when you have time take a refresher on part 1 and 2 of “Already Defined”.</p>

                <p>Today however we will look at a short series titled “New Year, New You” our scriptural study text
                    will be focused on <span class="bold">2 Corinthians 5:17-21 and Galatians 2:20. (READ)</span>
                    Now as has become tradition, many prior to any new year begin to sort out different resolutions they
                    want to accomplish in that new year. This maybe dieting, to exercise, to new relationships, jobs
                    goals and so on. The trend in the world today is making oneself over no matter the cost or physical
                    endangerment. It used to be a time when this was done more from a mental, self perspective or by
                    adjusting ones physical surroundings, such as moving from a cold city to a warmer city.
                    Unfortunately more and more we are seeing it done to ones actual physical person such as plastic
                    surgery.</p>

                <p>The problem with all the afore mentioned approaches is yes they may temporarily change the appearance
                    of the outside but they have no lasting impact on what’s happening on the inside. You see, the only
                    way to truly become a new you is to become a new you through Jesus Christ!</p>

                <p>Spiritual redemption through salvation permanently changes you on the inside and should reflect who
                    lives in you on the outside. This new found you can now have a right standing relationship with God
                    the Father all because Jesus Christ gave Himself for you. There is no insurance required, no high
                    cost premiums to pay, there is no anesthesia or surgery required on your part. Jesus took care of
                    all the pain and suffering long ago! Then He rose from the grave and stood on the cost of every sin
                    that could condemn us in this life. Therefore your new you is absolutely free of charge! All you
                    simply have to do is confess it, believe it and accept that Jesus Christ is Savior and Lord. That He
                    has all power given unto Him by God the Father.</p>

                <p>Now you may say well what will this new you look like in the new year, well it will for sure look a
                    lot better than the old you did in the old year, you can count on that. In part 2 we will break down
                    our scriptural study text to get deeper into exactly what the new you, if you accept Christ will
                    look like.</p>

                <p>Until then may God by his grace and provision cover and keep us all until we meet again.  Amen.</p>
