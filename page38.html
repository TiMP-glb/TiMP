                <p>Blessings and grace to you all TiMP Nation on this Sunday in which we celebrate our Mothers. As many
                    of you know I always express how God as shined upon me with the blessing of two Mothers to honor and
                    celebrate. My wonderful mother Mrs. Burris whom with God’s guidance and help raised a son in the
                    tough city of Detroit all on her own. Words cannot fully express her love, courage and commitment.
                    Then I was blessed again through the honor and privilege of marriage to gain a second mother Mrs.
                    Bonilla who raised 3 wonderful human beings 2 girls and 1 boy with a passion an unmatched love. One
                    of those children turned out to be my beautiful sister Jennifer who is an amazing and thoughtful mom
                    and wife. The other girl turned out to be my lovely wife Karla. She is just an incredible gift to my
                    life, our home and our children and I try my best to show my love, appreciation and thanks for her
                    every chance I get.</p>

                <p>To all my aunts, cousins and friends who are mothers, I salute you all as well. With that said I
                    thought to honor all Mothers this week, what better story than that of Elisha and the woman from
                    Shunem. What’s unique about this story other than God’s miracle working power of resurrection which
                    is ultimately a picture of Jesus. It is the the Shunammite woman’s amazing heart for caring and her
                    secret desire to be a mother. Which God reveals to Elisha to speak over her life and brings it to
                    pass. But more importantly her strong faith when tested and how God honors a mother’s love and faith
                    in Him. So please read and enjoy and Happy Mother’s Day!</p>

                <p><span class="bold">2 Kings 4:8-37 (NLT)</span></p>

                <p>8One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there, and she urged him to come to
                    her home for a meal. After that, whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for something to
                    eat. 9She said to her husband, “I am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of
                    God.
                    10Let’s build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a
                    lamp. Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by.”</p>

                <p>11One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to this upper room to rest. 12He said to his
                    servant Gehazi, “Tell the woman from Shunem I want to speak to her.” When she appeared, 13Elisha
                    said to Gehazi, “Tell her, ‘We appreciate the kind concern you have shown us. What can we do for
                    you? Can we put in a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’” “No,” she
                    replied, “my family takes good care of me.”</p>

                <p>14Later Elisha asked Gehazi, “What can we do for her?” Gehazi replied, “She doesn’t have a son, and
                    her husband is an old man.” 15“Call her back again,” Elisha told him. When the woman returned,
                    Elisha said to her as she stood
                    in the doorway, 16“Next year at this time you will be holding a son in your arms!” “No, my lord!”
                    she cried. “O man of God, don’t deceive me and get my hopes up like that.”</p>

                <p>17But sure enough, the woman soon became pregnant. And at that time the following year she had a son,
                    just as Elisha had said. 18One day when her child was older, he went out to help his father, who was
                    working with the
                    harvesters. 19Suddenly he cried out, “My head hurts! My head hurts!” His father said to one of the
                    servants, “Carry him home to his mother.”</p>

                <p>20So the servant took him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But around noontime he died.
                    21She carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and left him
                    there. 22She sent a message to her husband: “Send one of the servants and a donkey so that I can
                    hurry to the man of God and come right back.”</p>

                <p>23“Why go today?” he asked. “It is neither a new moon festival nor a Sabbath.” But she said, “It will
                    be all right.”
                    24So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant, “Hurry! Don’t slow down unless I tell you to.”
                    25As she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel, Elisha saw her in the distance. He said to
                    Gehazi, “Look, the woman from Shunem is coming.</p>

                <p> 26Run out to meet her and ask her, ‘Is everything all right with you, your husband, and your
                    child?’” “Yes,” the woman told Gehazi, “everything is fine.”
                    27But when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she fell to the ground before him and caught
                    hold of his feet. Gehazi began to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone. She is
                    deeply troubled, but the LORD has not told me what it is.”
                    28Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? And didn’t I say, ‘Don’t deceive me and get my
                    hopes up’?”</p>

                <p>29Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Get ready to travela; take my staff and go! Don’t talk to anyone along
                    the way. Go quickly and lay the staff on the child’s face.”
                    30But the boy’s mother said, “As surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, I won’t go home
                    unless you go with me.” So Elisha returned with her.
                    31Gehazi hurried on ahead and laid the staff on the child’s face, but nothing happened. There was no
                    sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and told him, “The child is still dead.”</p>

                <p>32When Elisha arrived, the child was indeed dead, lying there on the prophet’s bed. 33He went in
                    alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the LORD. 34Then he lay down on the child’s body,
                    placing his mouth on the child’s mouth, his eyes on the child’s eyes, and his hands on the child’s
                    hands. And as he stretched out on him, the child’s body began to grow warm again!</p>

                <p>35Elisha got up, walked back and forth across the room once, and then stretched himself out again on
                    the child. This time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes!
                    36Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. “Call the child’s mother!” he said. And when she came in, Elisha
                    said, “Here, take your son!” 37She fell at his feet and bowed before him, overwhelmed with
                    gratitude. Then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs.</p>
