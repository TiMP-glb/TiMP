                <p>Welcome! As we resume our series Unchallenging Church after a week of hiatus. Let’s continue from the
                    point of the fully sustaining source which is God’s word discussed in Part 1. When we look at
                    something that is a fully sustaining source, we understand it is imperative for our survival.
                    Therefore, we would understand the opposite, that without this source there would be a struggle to
                    live or in how we live. Consequently, there is a major struggle in today’s church as the word is
                    being contextually manipulated and watered down. The contextual manipulation and watering are
                    purposeful by the hands of those who are supposed to be the gatekeepers of this vital necessity. And
                    due to the inability of people to comprehend and accept the truth of the gospel because they are
                    spiritually blind and asleep, many false teachers and doctrines are able to thrive. This was true in
                    Isaiah’s time back in old testament Israel and even Moses’s dealings with them as well. <span
                        class="bold">Read Deuteronomy 29:1-6.</span> And so, it is also prevalent in the modern new
                    testament church today. Paul
                    actually refers to Isaiah’s writing in Romans 11:7-8 when discussing the hardening of our unbelief.
                </p>

                <p>Now, again as previously noted, this surely is not the case for all churches. However, we would be
                    naïve to think the majority of wayward churches do not represent the whole in relative perception.
                    If we recall our textual scripture from <span class="bold">Isaiah 29:9-16</span> for this series,
                    God calls out the false
                    hearts that are far from Him. This is the direction of the modern unchallenging church today which
                    is creating a mass following of what I like to call “grazing believers”. These grazing believers are
                    satisfied with entertainment that is “church” rather than the substance that is Jesus! These grazing
                    believers regularly attend church but rarely pick up the word to seek God for themselves. They are
                    not overly concerned with spending quality time with the sustaining source so as to be firmly rooted
                    in it. They are completely satisfied, as long as the speaker says something they can pick and choose
                    from the word to benefit how they see God fitting into their life.</p>

                <p>This backward mindset makes it easy for most churches today to get away with the appetizer gospel.
                    Most have figured it’s extremely profitable to serve just enough of the word not to offend. But just
                    enough to keep you coming back. Is it not interesting that if you serve cookies daily to a child it
                    will be completely ok with that, and would not challenge you otherwise? And if you consistently gave
                    a cookie every time that child will follow you anywhere. But if you decided one day to give that
                    same child broccoli or cauliflower, how dare you and now the child is unhappy and dissatisfied. This
                    is an example of the struggle going on in today’s modern church. As most think in order to satisfy
                    their members who are in need of real nourishment, simply give them a cookie. As a result, there is
                    no challenge to ensure a deeper spirit filled and more holy reverent approach to the throne of God.
                    Alter calls and accountability before His presence are a thing of the past, and have been replaced
                    by agreeable weightless greetings in the halls before and after service. Many today are struggling
                    with God’s
                    written word and His principles. Because we try or desire to bend them to our own will, rather than
                    challenging ourselves to be obedient to the will of God for His good pleasure. Read <span
