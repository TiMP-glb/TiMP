                <p>Once again, the US is in the headlines for another life of color senselessly taken. In
                    actuality there have been 3 recent deaths that have received worldwide attention. They
                    all involve people of color, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery. This is
                    nothing new nor will it cease at any point. This also does not mean that others not of
                    color or even police officers, have not had their lives taken senselessly. Anyone should
                    be sensitive to that when these conversations are had. However, we must acknowledge that
                    the world structure is not designed to provide equality. Therefore, it presents
                    opportunity to skew areas of society to favor certain people of economic class or race
                    over others. In most parts of the world it is factual that a White person will be
                    presented with greater opportunity and leniency than say a Black, Latino or other person
                    of color. The saddest reality for parents of color is educating our children to be aware
                    that even, riding in their car, jogging or simply walking down the street, can turn
                    wrong all because of their skin color. This is definitely a stark reality here in the US
                    and for a greater perspective look no further than our prison system or slavery as a
                    foundation for building this nation. Some aspects of slavery and even the short falls of
                    civil rights still exist today, they are just packaged in a less obvious manner. There
                    is a line from a famous movie that says “Attitude reflects leadership” or in this
                    country’s past and present state the lack there of.</p>

                <p>We often forget that there has always been an epidemic or pandemic if you prefer in this
                    country and throughout the world. <span class="bold">Its name is Sin.</span> Long before any disease
                    ever panicked
                    the earth or racism ran ramped in the streets. Sin was and still is the leading cause of
                    death. You see sin is what pits one against God and against others. It causes those in
                    the highest of places to disregard those in low places. Sin is what motivates and
                    nurtures hate and gives it a place to reside in hearts of men and women. Sin is the horn
                    blowing on a speeding train passing too fast for you recognize but it has your
                    attention. Sin’s vision is chaos and destruction and one’s life has no importance in its
                    travels.</p>

                <p>Sin provides liquid courage to cowards regardless of race, creed, color, economic status
                    or uniform. Sin has no value system, no moral compass, no compassion or empathy. The
                    world moves along every day and most people consistently turn a blind eye to social
                    injustices. The only time it will matter to those folks is when an injustice is at their
                    front door. Then they will want to march, protest or otherwise speak out. But if it’s
                    across the street, next door or around the corner that’s none of their concern. Most
                    communities large and small are the enablers to the injustices we see. They allow those
                    who do wrong and break rules to repeatedly do so and live normal comfortable lives with
                    little or no repercussion. Sadly, some of those wrong doers include the very people who
                    are charged to uphold the rules. It occurs daily where someone is putting their knee on
                    someone else’s neck whether, physically, mentally, judicially or economically.</p>

                <p>Then when the tired become restless and the restless become enraged strangely they are
                    the problem. Being honest, they do play a role in the problem because when they become
                    consumed, they can’t see through the storm that sin creates. The mission then becomes
                    tear down their own communities to be heard. What is intended as a means to stand up and
                    fight back, in the end simply plays into the system created to keep them oppressed and
                    viewed as a threat. None the less can you blame them? Imagine crying out for help every
                    day of your life and yet no one answers? How long would you be able to wear those shoes?</p>

                <p>Does this mean that every Black or Latino person is innocent in all the cases we read
                    and hear about? Absolutely not. However, does it not mean unless presenting an imminent
                    threat, they don’t deserve to live to have their day in court? To be afforded the right
                    to prove their innocence or guilt, because once they are dead that opportunity is lost.
                    We must begin to see that social injustice, racism, bigotry and inequality is not a
                    black, brown or white problem it’s a sin problem. Unfortunately, because we as people
                    don’t protest sin of every kind in our lives and communities, that is the real
                    injustice. Until we do, sin will continue to make it hard for anyone to breathe.</p>

                <p>This is why Jesus himself a man of color, came down from heaven to suffer and die at the
                    hands of his own creation. Yes, contrary to popular belief he was not a blue eyed,
                    blonde haired white man when he took on flesh. Why is this important? Well, when
                    knowledge is given, false perceptions become clear and truth can create effective
                    change. The truth is the risen Jesus has afforded us all regardless of color the
                    opportunity to be forgiven and to conquer sin in our lives. If we all from world
                    leaders, law enforcement to common everyday people spent more time with Jesus. We would
                    spend less time killing, oppressing, hating and more time interacting with love.</p>
