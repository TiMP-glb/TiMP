                <p>Ok, let’s get into the next plot against Daniel. Now history tells us Daniel had just witnessed the
                    murder and overthrow of Belshazzar on Oct 16, 539 B.C. And that King Cyrus (Darius the Mede) and his
                    Medo-Persian army fully enter Babylon on Oct 26, 539 B.C. This puts Daniel under his third ruler,
                    he’s
                    been in captivity roughly 70 years. However, God has used his situation to elevate him amongst kings
                    and
                    the upper class of Babylon. Actually, if you really consider, Daniel is the most influential man
                    even
                    above the kings he served. So much so that Satan has to do something to try and get rid of him. In
                    chapter 6 we find King Cyrus appointing “satraps” these are provincial administrators primarily
                    tasked
                    to assist in the vision/direction of the king. This could be things such as implementation of
                    development projects and the delivery of the basic services in the province. They would also be in
                    charge of the daily administrative and internal operations of the province they are assigned. To
                    understand the scope of Cyrus’s domain he had 120 satraps. Daniel’s role became that of governor,
                    one of
                    three assisting the king as his vice-regents. This means they acted in place of the king when
                    appointed
                    to do so. This would be similar to a vice-president today.</p>

                <p>What happens next is Daniel rises above the other two governors and all the satraps in the eye of the
                    king. The king considered heavily making Daniel head of his entire kingdom. Now it’s important we
                    don’t
                    miss God is orchestrating this place of influence to assist in the Jews return to Judah. The bible
                    and
                    history note this return did occur between 539 – 537 B.C. while Cyrus is ruler. <span
                        class="bold">(For reference read Ezra
                        chapters 1 and 6).</span> This also does occur before the lion’s den incident. When we study
                    this, we find that
                    in the first year of king Cyrus he makes a proclamation to this fact. Thus, fulfilling the prophesy
                    God
                    had given Jeremiah, where in reading you will find Judah had rebelled. This was a result of the
                    Kingdom
                    of Israel (Samaria) becoming split into two kingdoms Judah being the other. They then followed in
                    the
                    same disobedient way as Israel. This angered God but he promised if they would repent, he would
                    deliver
                    them and one day restore them to Israel.</p>

                <p>This now ties back to <span class="bold">Daniel chapter 1</span> Nebuchadnezzar over takes Judah and
                    destroys the temple and
                    takes the articles and vessels etc. Cyrus through the afore mentioned proclamation starts to rebuild
                    the
                    temple and returns the contents to the temple as the process of restoration begins. As a note Cyrus
                    doesn’t complete the temple as work is halted at one point for roughly 16 years. It resumed under
                    King
                    Darius of Persia using the proclamation originally issued by King Cyrus (Darius the Mede). Hopefully
                    this eliminates any King Darius confusion if you read Ezra to learn more of the temple rebuild.</p>

                <p>Well here we go, what you have all been waiting for! How does Daniel end up in the lion's den after
                    all this
                    and how does all this make sense? Obviously, the other governors and satraps were angered at the
                    favor
                    bestowed on Daniel by the king. So they set out to find dirt on him, just like politics is done
                    today.
                    Except Daniel was faithful and a just man so they couldn’t find a single thing. Just like it had
                    happened years earlier to the fiery furnace boys, the enemies say “Hey king no one should worship
                    anyone
                    but you for 30 days.” “Decree it to be so if they worship another, into the lion’s den they go”. Now
                    we learned
                    prior that Daniel prays three times a day to God, so obviously they knew he wouldn’t last one second
                    with this rule. Soon after they catch him praying they return to the king to spill their guts <span
                        class="bold">Daniel
                        6:4-13.</span> When the king hears this he is unhappy, but not with Daniel with himself. So, he
                    sets out to try
                    and save Daniel from the consequences. However, the enemies were relentless and basically said to
                    the
                    king “Hey you can’t let this slide, your word is your word”. King Cyrus then sends Daniel to the
                    lion’s
                    den. Now most historians date Daniel’s life to have been from 620-538 B.C., which means Daniel was
                    around 80 years old when this occurred. This is one of the most amazing writings in the word of God
                    when
                    you read <span class="bold">Daniel 6:16-23.</span> You see where most read this and see the end, God
                    meant it for a beginning.
                    Before entering that tomb Daniel clearly understood that the lion (Satan) was not King. This passage
                    by
                    design is to reflect the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ! As a matter of fact, this
                    whole
                    book really brings together the full picture of Jesus and His gift of salvation for us. I will break
                    it
                    out for you below.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">The Temple:</span> this relates from Daniel as Jesus metaphorically describes
                    Himself as this Temple in the new
                    testament. See <span class="bold">Mark 14:58</span> when Jesus is before the council after being
                    arrested in the garden and see
                    John 2:19 when Jesus clears the temple with the money changers. Why use a temple metaphor? Well a
                    temple
                    is a sacred place you dwell and worship in, which is exactly what God wants us to do with him.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Restoration:</span> Unlike the temple in the old testament that took much longer
                    to rebuild. When you read the
                    above reference scriptures about the Temple. Jesus clearly states He will rebuild the Temple not
                    made
                    with human hands (referring to Himself) in 3 days. Remember the stone from <span class="bold">Daniel
                        2:45</span> that was
                    a direct reference to Jesus being the Temple.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Death/Burial/Resurrection:</span> The enemies thought the tomb of the lion’s den
                    was the end of Daniel. So
                    thought Satan that the death of Jesus on the cross was the end, but death could not hold Him. See
                    <span class="bold">Acts
                        2:24.</span> Daniel was placed in a den (wild animal habitat) which was basically a tomb like
                    structure and a
                    stone rolled and sealed in front of it. This reflects Jesus being buried in a borrowed tomb with a
                    stone
                    rolled and sealed in front of it. See <span class="bold">Matthew 27:57-66.</span> Daniel’s one-night
                    stay in the tomb was not a
                    literal resurrection. However, it represents Jesus literally after death and burial rebuilding the
                    Temple (Himself) and walking out of the tomb. It showed that He had conquered death and that He
                    indeed
                    is the risen Messiah that Daniel and all the prophets spoke of long ago. See <span
                        class="bold">Isaiah 53:1-12.</span></p>

                <p><span class="bold">Repentance:</span> Just like Israel and Judah in the days of old, God is calling
                    us modern time folks to
                    repentance today. See <span class="bold">Acts 17:30</span></p>

                <p><span class="bold">Salvation:</span> King Cyrus (Darius the Mede) wanted to save Daniel, however he
                    could not. The opportunity for
                    eternal salvation from death which is the consequence of our sins can only come through Jesus
                    Christ.
                    This reiterates God’s promise to deliver and restore us unto Himself. See <span class="bold">Acts
                        4:12 and 1 Timothy 2:5.</span></p>
