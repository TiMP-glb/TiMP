                <p>Well TiMP Nation I had planned to begin our new short series but we will kick that off next week. God
                    was speaking to my heart to provide a small bit of perspective to recent events in my country. As
                    many of you know that are a part of TiMP nation around the world, America is in the throws of a
                    contentious election which has caused much divisiveness, racism, bigotry, lying rhetoric and moral
                    decay all for greed, power and privilege. Now, I in particular have no political loyalties my only
                    preference is I would love to see a true man of God holding that position one day. Only God has the
                    power and authority to place such a person if he so sees fit <span class="bold">Romans 13:1</span>.
                    However, there comes a
                    time when we must be honest about what is right in front of us.</p>

                <p>A true fundamental of life is that some will be leaders and some will be followers. But we must be
                    mindful how we lead or who we look to for leadership. Only fools lead with folly and only fools
                    follow foolishness. Now with that said real leaders lead not with the conviction for themselves but
                    with a humble heart and desire to serve others. We find this example of true leadership in Jesus
                    Christ when He is washing His disciple’s feet <span class="bold">John 13:1-17</span>. In context and
                    focusing on verse 5, it
                    was just before the Passover Festival and Jesus was in His final hours on earth before returning
                    back to glory to be with God the Father. So here is Jesus, in His last moments not that He hadn’t
                    done enough already by giving His life, being buried and resurrecting all so that we’d have the
                    opportunity for salvation. He decides to pour water in a basin and start washing and drying the
                    filthy feet of His disciples! The reason for this was to show an example of selfless service and
                    great love which was also shown by His death on the cross.</p>

                <p>You see in this day and time and even now the act of washing feet is considered work for the lowest
                    of servants and a very menial task. Even the disciples could not bring themselves to wash each
                    other’s feet and were actually arguing over who was the greatest amongst them <span
                        class="bold">Luke 22:24-27</span>. Which
                    prompted Jesus in that moment to set the standard by which we are to live, lead and hold each other
                    accountable too. He simply asked them who is greater, the one sitting at the table or the one
                    serving it? Many are wondering what the soon to be former President is going to do in the aftermath
                    and for that matter the newly elected President. My prayer and hope are that they repent if they
                    have not done so already and turn from their wicked ways and seek to serve the Lord with all their
                    heart, mind, body and soul. Because what profit is there for a man or woman to gain the whole world
                    and lose their soul? <span class="bold">Mark 8:36, Matthew 16:26</span></p>
